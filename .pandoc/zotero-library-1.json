  {"id":"Abdel-aal.etal_2019_ReviewSeismotectonic","abstract":"The Gulf of Aqaba is one of the most active places around Egypt, with several earthquake sequences having occurred there through ancient and modern times. In the last century, four earthquake sequences took place in the gulf (1983, 1990, 1993, and 1995). Recently, on 27 June 2015, a sequence of 96 earthquakes with local magnitudes ranging from 0.7 to 5.2 was recorded by the Egyptian National Seismological Network (ENSN). On 16 May 2016, another earthquake sequence started and continued for several consecutive days, with 95 events with local magnitudes ranging from 1.6 to 5.5 being centered south of the 27 June 2015 sequence. In this paper, we analyse the complete waveform and polarity data set of both earthquake sequences to determine their focal mechanisms and to update our knowledge of the stress ﬁeld in the Gulf of Aqaba. Through the results obtained, we conclude that, the Gulf of Aqaba is affected by a primary structure of a left-lateral strike-slip fault with a minor normal component in most segments. Our study also infers the presence of a secondary structure, which is indicated to be a right-lateral strike-slip with a minor reverse component.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Abd el-aal","given":"Abd el-aziz Khairy"},{"family":"Mostafa","given":"Shaimaa Ismail"},{"family":"Abdelhafiez","given":"H.

To investigate the source process of both events, we inverted the teleseismic P- and SH-waveform data using an iterative technique in which the rupture is modeled as a series of point source subevents with varying mechanisms. The main source process of the 1993 event can be explained by two subevents with essentially the same mechanism. These two subevents had different focal depths. The second subevent was about 5 s later than the first one and about 70% of the moment rate released with the second one. The total rupture duration time was about 12 s. Our solution for the 1995 Gulf of Aqaba earthquake indicated that the event consists of three subevents with various fault geometries and about 60% of the moment released by the second subevent. The first subevent occurred at a depth of 13 km, and was followed after 9 s by the second one at a depth of 11 km; the third subevent, at a depth of 9 km occurred 19 s after the second one. The total duration of the earthqauke rupture process was about 18.7 s. The obtained mechanisms for the 1993 and 1995 Gulf of Aqaba earthquakes are well correlated with the structural setting of the Gulf of Aqaba.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Abdel-Fattah","given":"Ali K."},{"family":"Hussein","given":"H.

The spectra of the cluster of M 1.9 earthquakes include high-frequency energy not fit by simple source models and so stress drops are unreliable, and probably underestimated (1–20 MPa). There is no correlation with previous studies, and interevent variation is not resolvable. The earthquakes in the smallest magnitude cluster (M 1.8) have the highest corner frequencies, but similar stress drops (4–120 MPa).

The earthquakes in the largest (M 2.1) repeating sequence targeted by the San Andreas Observatory at Depth (SAFOD), Parkfield, California, are recorded by multiple borehole stations and have simple sources, well-constrained stress drops, and abundant smaller earthquakes to use as EGFs. I perform three tests to estimate quantitatively the likely uncertainties to arise in less optimal settings. I use EGF earthquakes with a range of cross-correlation values and separation distances from the main earthquakes. The stress drop measurements decrease by a factor of 3 as the quality of the EGF assumption decreases; a good EGF must be located within approximately one source dimension of the large earthquake, with high cross correlation. I subsample the large number of measurements for the main earthquakes to investigate the expected stress drop uncertainties in studies where fewer stations or EGFs are available. If only one measurement is available, the uncertainties are likely to be at least 50%. The uncertainties decrease to <20% with five or more measurements; using multiple EGFs is a good alternative to multiple stations. To investigate the effects of limited frequency bandwidth, I recalculate the corner frequencies after progressively decimating the sample rate. Decreasing the high-frequency limit of the bandwidth decreases the estimate of the corner frequency (and stress drop).

  {"id":"Acocella_2007_UnderstandingCaldera","abstract":"Understanding the structure and development of calderas is crucial for predicting their behaviour during periods of unrest and to plan geothermal and ore exploitation. Geological data, including that from analysis of deeply eroded examples, allow the overall surface setting of calderas to be defined, whereas deep drillings and geophysical investigations provide insights on their subsurface structure. Collation of this information from calderas worldwide has resulted in the recent literature in five main caldera types (downsag, piston, funnel, piecemeal, trapdoor), being viewed as end-members. Despite its importance, such a classification does not adequately examine: (a) the structure of calderas (particularly the nature of the caldera's bounding faults); and (b) how this is achieved (including the genetic relationships among the five caldera types). Various sets of analogue models, specifically devoted to study caldera architecture and development, have been recently performed, under different conditions (apparatus, materials, scaling parameters, stress conditions). The first part of this study reviews these experiments, which induce collapse as a result of underpressure or overpressure within the chamber analogue. The experiments simulating overpressure display consistent results, but the experimental depressions require an exceptional amount of doming, seldom observed in nature, to form; therefore, these experiments are not appropriate to understand the structure and formation of most natural calderas. The experiments simulating underpressure reveal a consistent scenario for caldera structure and development, regardless of their different boundary conditions. These show that complete collapse proceeds through four main stages, proportional to the amount of subsidence, progressively characterized by: (1) downsag; (2) reverse ring fault; (3) peripheral downsag; (4) peripheral normal ring fault. The second part of this study verifies the possibility that these latter calderas constitute a suitable analogue to nature and consists of a comprehensive comparison of the underpressure experiments to natural calderas. This shows that all the experimental structures, as well as their progressive development, are commonly observed at natural calderas, highlighting a consistency between models and nature. As the shallow structure of experimental calderas corresponds to a precise architecture at depth, it provides a unique key to infer the deeper structure of natural calderas: recognizing diagnostic surface features within a caldera will thus allow it to be categorized within a precise structural and evolutionary context. The general relationship between the evolutionary stage of a caldera and its d/s (diameter/subsidence) ratio allows such a quantification, with stage 1 calderas characterized by d/s>40, stage 2 by 18<d/s<40, stage 3 by 14<d/s<18 and stage 4 by d/s<14. The consistency between experiments and nature suggests that, in principle, the d/s ratio may permit to evaluate the overall structure and evolutionary stage of a caldera even when its surface structure is poorly known. The volume of erupted magma associated with caldera collapse is poorly dependent on the d/s ratio or evolutionary stage; however, the location of sin- and post-collapse volcanism may depend not only upon the amount of collapse, but also on the roof aspect ratio. As the regional tectonic control is concerned, the experiments explain the ellipticity of a part of natural calderas elongated parallel to the regional extension; the control of pre-existing structures may explain the elongation of elliptic calderas oblique or parallel to the regional structures. The four stages adequately explain the architecture and development of the established caldera end-members along a continuum, where one or more end-members (downsag, piston, funnel, piecemeal, trapdoor) may correspond to a specific stage. While such a continuum is controlled by progressive subsidence, specific collapse geometries will result from secondary contributory factors (roof aspect ratio, collapse symmetry, pre-existing faults). These considerations allow proposing an original classification of calderas, incorporating their structural and genetic features.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Acocella","given":"Valerio"}],"citation-key":"Acocella_2007_UnderstandingCaldera","container-title":"Earth-Science Reviews","container-title-short":"Earth-Science Reviews","DOI":"10.1016/j.earscirev.2007.08.004","ISSN":"0012-8252","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",12,1]]},"page":"125-160","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Understanding caldera structure and development: An overview of analogue models compared to natural calderas","title-short":"Understanding caldera structure and development","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825207001146","volume":"85"},
  {"id":"Acocella.etal_2000_AnalogueModels","abstract":"Collapse calderas and resurgent domes are a common association related to inflation–deflation processes in volcanic systems. The structure of calderas and domes depends upon the permitted, relative movements of crustal volumes at depth (the so-called “space problem”). In order to study the structures of collapse calderas and resurgent domes and to take the space problem into account, several analogue models were made. Dry-quartz sand was used to simulate the rheology of the brittle crust, while newtonian silicone putty, located at the base of the sand-pack, simulated the ductile behaviour of the magma. A piston moved the silicone putty downward or upward, inducing collapse and doming within the sand. Three separate sets of experiments simulated: (1) caldera collapse; (2) resurgence; and (3) superimposition of resurgence on collapse and vice versa. Collapse experiments are characterized by the development of two concentric depressions; the first-formed depression is bordered by outward dipping reverse ring faults; the subsequent, outer concentric depression is bordered by inward dipping normal ring faults. The deformation pattern during resurgence is a function of the overburden thickness (T) and the dome diameter (D). For higher T/D ratios a dome forms, bordered by inward dipping high angle reverse ring faults; outward dipping normal ring faults develop at late stages. For lower T/D ratios, the dome shows, at late stages, a crestal depression accompanied by radial fractures; subsequently, an apical extrusion of silicone occurs. The superimposition of resurgence over collapse (and vice versa) is characterized by the complete reactivation, with opposite kinematics, of all the pre-existing ring faults during inversion. Both in caldera and resurgence, reverse ring faults form in the early stages due to differential uplift; extensional structures subsequently form to accommodate gravitational collapse during the activity of the reverse faults. The experiments and the overall similarities with nature suggest that the activity of both reverse and normal faults constitutes a possible solution to the space problem during major collapses or resurgences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",2,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Acocella","given":"V."},{"family":"Cifelli","given":"F."},{"family":"Funiciello","given":"R."}],"citation-key":"Acocella.etal_2000_AnalogueModels","container-title":"Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research","container-title-short":"Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research","DOI":"10.1016/S0377-0273(00)00201-8","ISSN":"0377-0273","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",12,30]]},"page":"81-96","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Analogue models of collapse calderas and resurgent domes","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377027300002018","volume":"104"},

Caldera unrest is deﬁned by enhanced seismicity, gravity changes, surface deformation, and degassing. Although much caldera unrest does not lead to an eruption, every eruption is preceded by an unrest episode. Therefore, the proper description of unrest and the forecast of its possible outcome is a timely and challenging task. Here we review the best known unrest at calderas from 1988 to 2014, building on previous work and proposing an updated database. Where established, the root cause for unrest is always magmatic; none was purely hydrothermal or tectonic. An interpretive classiﬁcation of unrest invokes two spectra—compositional (maﬁc to felsic) and the state of magma conduits feeding from the magma reservoir(s) to the surface (from fully plugged, through semiplugged, to open). Magma and gas in open conduits can rise and erupt freely; magma in semiplugged conduits erupts less frequently yet still allows some gas to escape; plugged conduits allow neither magma nor gas to escape. Unrest in maﬁc calderas is subtler, less pronounced, and repeated, especially with open systems, ensuring the continuous, aseismic, and moderate release of magma. Plugged felsic calderas erupt infrequently, anticipated by isolated, short and seismically active unrest. Semiplugged felsic calderas also erupt infrequently and are restless over decades or centuries, with uplift, seismicity, and degassing and, on the longer-term, resurgence, suggesting repeated stalled intrusions. Finally, the expected advances in better understanding caldera unrest are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Acocella","given":"V."},{"family":"Di Lorenzo","given":"R."},{"family":"Newhall","given":"C."},{"family":"Scandone","given":"R."}],"citation-key":"Acocella.etal_2015_OverviewRecent","container-title":"Reviews of Geophysics","container-title-short":"Rev.

To better understand this process, we monitor the displacement field in scaled tectonic model experiments using high-resolution optical image correlation techniques (particle imaging velocimetry, PIV). 2D and 3D surface displacement data of extensional and contractional sandbox experiments show that the mode, pattern, and temporal variation of strain accumulation are strongly dependent on the non-linear strain-dependent frictional strength of granular model materials similar to natural deformation processes in brittle rocks. Strain hardening and softening control the shear zone formation. The pattern of localised deformation is established much earlier than is visible from visual inspection of the experiment. Evolution of distributed strain in the surrounding material of the shear zones and discontinuous shear re-localisation control later stages irrespective of the kinematic boundary conditions. High-resolution optical strain monitoring quantifies the spatial and temporal patterns of strain accumulation in our model experiments with unprecedented detail. Together with detailed characterisation of the deformation behaviour of the model materials, our experiments will help to re-evaluate important scaling issues, and allow accurate comparison of analogue experiments with numerical simulations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Adam","given":"J."},{"family":"Urai","given":"J.

We show that the detection level is slightly period dependent, and we provide an analytical expression relating the amplitude of seismicity-rate variations to the confidence level at which the probability that the observed variations be due to chance can be discarded. The Schuster spectrum also provides information about the deviation from a sinusoidal function of the periodicity of the seismicity rate, and identifies an eventual imperfect declustering of the catalog, making it coincidently a potential tool to determine whether or not a catalog has been properly declustered. Applying this tool to the Nepalese seismicity, we demonstrate annual variations of the seismicity rate of amplitude up to 40%, while no other periodicity appears. In particular, no variations of seismicity at any of the tidal periods are observed, indicating that the relative amplitude response of the seismicity at these periods is less than 18%.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Ader","given":"Thomas J."},{"family":"Avouac","given":"Jean-Philippe"}],"citation-key":"Ader.Avouac_2013_DetectingPeriodicities","container-title":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","container-title-short":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","DOI":"10.1016/j.epsl.2013.06.032","ISSN":"0012-821X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"97-105","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Detecting periodicities and declustering in earthquake catalogs using the Schuster spectrum, application to Himalayan seismicity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X13003555","volume":"377-378"},

  {"id":"Agustsdottir.etal_2019_IntenseSeismicity","abstract":"Over 2 weeks in August 2014, magma propagated 48 km laterally from Bárðarbunga volcano before erupting at Holuhraun for 6 months, accompanied by collapse of the caldera. A dense seismic network recorded over 47,000 earthquakes before, during, and after the rifting event. More than 30,000 earthquakes delineate the segmented dike intrusion. Earthquake source mechanisms show exclusively strike-slip faulting, occurring near the base of the dike along preexisting weaknesses aligned with the rift fabric, while the dike widened largely aseismically. The slip sense of faulting is controlled by the orientation of the dike relative to the local rift fabric, demonstrated by an abrupt change from right- to left-lateral faulting as the dike turns to propagate from an easterly to a northerly direction. Around 4,000 earthquakes associated with the caldera collapse delineate an inner caldera fault zone, with good correlation to geodetic observations. Caldera subsidence was largely aseismic, with seismicity accounting for 10% or less of the geodetic moment. Approximately 90% of the seismic moment release occurred on the northern rim, suggesting an asymmetric collapse. Well-constrained focal mechanisms reveal subvertical arrays of normal faults, with fault planes dipping inward at ∼60◦ ± 9◦, along both the north and south caldera margins. These steep normal faults strike subparallel to the caldera rims, with slip vectors pointing toward the center of subsidence. The maximum depth of seismicity defines the base of the seismogenic crust under Bárðarbunga as 6 km below sea level, in broad agreement with constraints from geodesy and geobarometry for the minimum depth to the melt storage region.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Ágústsdóttir","given":"Thorbjörg"},{"family":"Winder","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Woods","given":"Jennifer"},{"family":"White","given":"Robert S."},{"family":"Greenfield","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Brandsdóttir","given":"Bryndís"}],"citation-key":"Agustsdottir.etal_2019_IntenseSeismicity","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","container-title-short":"J.

Recent observations, however, unequivocally require the modification of the above law for periods T < 10s. Unfortunately, the presently available data are not sufficient for a unique revision of the scaling law. We propose two alternatives and discuss their implications and consequences. In either case, we have to conclude that a large earthquake and a small one are substantially different. One interesting feature of the o-square model appears to be unaffected by the required revision; that is, the spectral density of the fault-slip timefunction for periods T < 5 s takes the same absolute value, independent of magnitude, for earthquakes greater than M , = 6.5. This result has important consequences in earthquake engineering because the seismic motion in the vicinity of an earthquake fault will scale as the fault-slip motion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Aki","given":"K."}],"citation-key":"Aki_1972_ScalingLaw","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","container-title-short":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.1972.tb02356.x","ISSN":"0956-540X, 1365-246X","issue":"1-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1972",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"3-25","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Scaling Law of Earthquake Source Time-Function","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/gji/article-lookup/doi/10.1111/j.1365-246X.1972.tb02356.x","volume":"31"},
  {"id":"Aldaajani.etal_2021_PlumeSlabPull","abstract":"Mantle convection and the interaction of buoyant plumes with the lithosphere have been a significant influence on plate tectonics. Plume-lithosphere interactions have been regarded as a major driver of continental rifting, and have been linked to triple junction development and major supercontinent break-up events. There are also many extensional tectonic settings that lack evidence for a mantle plume and associated magmatism, indicating far-field plate stresses also drive plate fragmentation. The Arabian Plate is a spectacular active example where both a mantle plume and far-field plate stresses interact to drive continental break-up. Despite more than 80 years of geological research, there remains significant conjecture concerning the geodynamic processes responsible for the plate motion and the nature or onset of extension/deformation of the Arabian Plate. Complex structural patterns within the Arabian Plate have been interpreted in the context of tectonic plate movements and reorganization related to the subduction of the Tethys Oceanic plate, collision between Arabian and Eurasian plates, and the superposition of Afar plume. These interactions have accordingly resulted in different explanations or understanding of the geodynamic of the Afro-Arabian rift system. We assess the relative influence of plume vs. far field influences by reviewing the current views on the concept and models of these forces and highlighting their significance and implications on Arabia. Our synthesis shows that most of the geodynamical models proposed so far are not applicable to the entire Arabian Plate and its surrounding boundaries.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Aldaajani","given":"Thamer Z."},{"family":"Almalki","given":"Khalid A."},{"family":"Betts","given":"Peter G."}],"citation-key":"Aldaajani.etal_2021_PlumeSlabPull","container-title":"Frontiers in Earth Science","ISSN":"2296-6463","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Plume Versus Slab-Pull: Example from the Arabian Plate","title-short":"Plume Versus Slab-Pull","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feart.2021.700550","volume":"9"},

The recent occurrence of this rifting and the multi-stage evolution of the plate boundary has preserved of key components of the early-stage plate boundary development. We find that the Makkah–Madinah Transform Zone (MMTZ) represents a rift-to-rift continental transform fault that served as a primary component of the initial plate boundary between Arabia and Nubia. It connected the more evolved southern Red Sea mid-ocean ridge to the initially dominant Sirhan Rift. During this time, the MMTZ served as a primary lithospheric-scale boundary between the Arabia and Nubia plates.

The estimated median stress drops show significant lateral variations: we find lower stress drops in the Middle Mountain asperity and along the creeping fault section, and higher stress drops in the hypocentral region of the 2004 M6.0 Parkfield earthquake. The main shock did not alter the overall pattern of high and low stress drop regions. However, a statistical test reveals areas with significant changes in computed stress drops after the main shock, which we compare to estimated absolute shear stress changes from a main shock slip model. By calculating Δt* from the spectral EGF ratio, we also identify areas with increased attenuation after the main shock, and we are able to distinguish source effects and near-source attenuation effects in the spectral analysis.

  {"id":"Altamimi.etal_2017_ITRF2014Plate","abstract":"For various geodetic and geophysical applications, users need to have access to a plate motion model (PMM) that is consistent with the ITRF2014 frame. This paper describes the approach used for determining a PMM from the horizontal velocities of a subset of the ITRF2014 sites away from plate boundaries, Glacial Isostatic Adjustment regions and other deforming zones. In theory it would be necessary to include in the inversion model a translational motion vector (called in this paper origin rate bias, ORB) that would represent the relative motion between the ITRF2014 origin (long-term averaged centre of mass of the Earth as sensed by SLR) and the centre of tectonic plate motion. We show that in practice, the magnitude of the estimated ORB is strongly dependent on the selection of ITRF2014 sites used for the PMM adjustment. Its Z-component can in particular range between 0 and more than 1 mm yr−1 depending on the station network used, preventing any geophysical interpretation of the estimated value. Relying on rigorous statistical criteria, the site selection finally adopted for the ITRF2014-PMM adjustment leads to a relatively small ORB (0.30 ± 0.18 mm yr−1 in the Z-component), which is statistically insignificant at the 2-sigma level, but also according to an F-ratio test. Therefore we opted for an ITRF2014-PMM without estimating the ORB, which in turn accommodates geodetic applications that require access to the ITRF2014 frame through pure plate rotation poles.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Altamimi","given":"Zuheir"},{"family":"Métivier","given":"Laurent"},{"family":"Rebischung","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Rouby","given":"Hélène"},{"family":"Collilieux","given":"Xavier"}],"citation-key":"Altamimi.etal_2017_ITRF2014Plate","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","container-title-short":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1093/gji/ggx136","ISSN":"0956-540X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",6,1]]},"page":"1906-1912","source":"Silverchair","title":"ITRF2014 plate motion model","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggx136","volume":"209"},

Cerro Azul and Fernandina erupted4,5,6 during the observation period and show evidence of inflation, co-eruptive deflation and shallow dyke intrusion. In contrast, the largest volcano, Sierra Negra, has not erupted, yet exhibits spatially and temporally variable deformation, with a maximum uplift of 2.7 m between 1992 and 1999, which can be modelled by a shallow inflating sill. Inflation during 1997–98, however, was accompanied by ‘trapdoor’ faulting on a steeply dipping fracture system within the caldera. Repeated trapdoor faulting over geological time has formed an arcuate intra-caldera ridge within Sierra Negra and may have acted to relax stresses above the magma chamber, inhibiting summit eruptions.

Observations from the formation of a 0.8–cubic kilometer basaltic caldera at Kīlauea Volcano in 2018 included the draining of an active lava lake, which provided a window into pressure decrease in the reservoir.

Several cubic kilometers of magma were stored in the reservoir, and only a fraction was withdrawn before the end of the eruption. Thus, caldera formation may begin after withdrawal of only small amounts of magma and may end before source reservoirs are completely evacuated.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Anderson","given":"Kyle R."},{"family":"Johanson","given":"Ingrid A."},{"family":"Patrick","given":"Matthew R."},{"family":"Gu","given":"Mengyang"},{"family":"Segall","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Poland","given":"Michael P."},{"family":"Montgomery-Brown","given":"Emily K."},{"family":"Miklius","given":"Asta"}],"citation-key":"Anderson.etal_2019_MagmaReservoir","container-title":"Science","container-title-short":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.aaz1822","ISSN":"0036-8075, 1095-9203","issue":"6470","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12,6]]},"language":"en","page":"eaaz1822","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Magma reservoir failure and the onset of caldera collapse at Kīlauea Volcano in 2018","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aaz1822","volume":"366"},
  {"id":"Antoine.etal_2023_DiffuseDeformation","abstract":"Abstract\n          Continental earthquakes produce both localized deformation on faults and diffuse deformation in the surrounding medium. Diffuse deformation can occur up to ~2 km from the faults, and may accommodate a significant part of the surface displacement associated with the earthquake. However, the origin of the diffuse deformation and its role in the rupture process are still not clearly understood. Here, taking advantage of exceptional datasets for the 2019 Ridgecrest, California, earthquake sequence, we perform a joint inversion of InSAR, GNSS, and high-resolution optical correlation data, and demonstrate that the decrease of coseismic slip toward the ground surface observed in earthquake rupture models, also known as shallow slip deficit (SSD), directly correlates with the occurrence of diffuse deformation at the surface. Thus, adding the localized and the diffuse components of the surface deformation, we show that the amount of surface displacement is consistent with the displacement occurring at depth on the faults. Hence, SSD in earthquake source models should generally be interpreted as a proxy for diffuse deformation, a mode of deformation that cannot be accounted for by elastic earthquake models. Revisiting earthquake source models for 29 continental earthquakes, we show that the amplitude of the inferred SSD is inversely proportional to the square of the earthquake magnitude, and that SSD and diffuse deformation are only significant for medium to small magnitude events.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Antoine","given":"Solene"},{"family":"Klinger","given":"Yann"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Kang"},{"family":"Bürgmann","given":"Roland"}],"citation-key":"Antoine.etal_2023_DiffuseDeformation","DOI":"10.21203/rs.3.rs-2536085/v1","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,14]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC:00000","publisher":"In Review","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Diffuse deformation explains the magnitude-dependent coseismic shallow slip deficit","type":"report","URL":"https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2536085/v1"},

Recent development of geophysical monitoring in Asama Volcano allows us to infer the magma pathway and its structural controls beneath the volcano. Combining geodetic data and precise earthquake locations during recent eruptions suggests that the magma intrudes several kilometres to the west of the summit to a depth of about 1 km below sea level as a nearly east–west-trending dyke. The vertically intruded magma then moves horizontally by several kilometres to beneath the summit before it ascends vertically to make the surface. Combining the P-wave velocity and the resistivity structure shows that the intrusions are under structural controls. Frozen and fractureless magma associated with volcanic activity until 24 000 years ago impedes the ascent of rising magma on its way to the surface. The S-wave velocity structure inferred from ambient noise tomography reveals a low-velocity body beneath the modelled dyke. From independent information, we have inferred that this low-velocity body is likely to be a magma chamber.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Aoki","given":"Yosuke"},{"family":"Takeo","given":"Minoru"},{"family":"Ohminato","given":"Takao"},{"family":"Nagaoka","given":"Yutaka"},{"family":"Nishida","given":"Kiwamu"}],"citation-key":"Aoki.etal_2013_MagmaPathway","container-title":"Geological Society, London, Special Publications","container-title-short":"Geological Society, London, Special Publications","DOI":"10.1144/SP380.6","ISSN":"0305-8719, 2041-4927","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"en","page":"67-84","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Magma pathway and its structural controls of Asama Volcano, Japan","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://sp.lyellcollection.org/lookup/doi/10.1144/SP380.6","volume":"380"},
  {"id":"Argus.etal_2010_AngularVelocities","abstract":"Using space geodetic observations from four techniques (GPS, VLBI, SLR and DORIS), we simultaneously estimate the angular velocities of 11 major plates and the velocity of Earth's centre. We call this set of relative plate angular velocities GEODVEL (for GEODesy VELocity).Plate angular velocities depend on the estimate of the velocity of Earth's centre and on the assignment of sites to plates. Most geodetic estimates of the angular velocities of the plates are determined assuming that Earth's centre is fixed in an International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF), and are therefore subject to errors in the estimate of the velocity of Earth's centre. In ITRF2005 and ITRF2000, Earth's centre is the centre of mass of Earth, oceans and atmosphere (CM); the velocity of CM is estimated by SLR observation of LAGEOS's orbit. Herein we define Earth's centre to be the centre of mass of solid Earth (CE); we determine the velocity of CE by assuming that the portions of plate interiors not near the late Pleistocene ice sheets move laterally as if they were part of a rigid spherical cap. The GEODVEL estimate of the velocity of CE is likely nearer the true velocity of CM than are the ITRF2005 and ITRF2000 estimates because (1) no phenomena can sustain a significant velocity between CM and CE, (2) the plates are indeed nearly rigid (aside from vertical motion) and (3) the velocity of CM differs between ITRF2005 and ITRF2000 by an unacceptably large speed of 1.8 mm yr−1. The velocity of Earth's centre in GEODVEL lies between that of ITRF2000 and that of ITRF2005, with the distance from ITRF2005 being about twice that from ITRF2000. Because the GEODVEL estimates of uncertainties in plate angular velocities account for uncertainty in the velocity of Earth's centre, they are more realistic than prior estimates of uncertainties.GEODVEL differs significantly from all prior global sets of relative plate angular velocities determined from space geodesy. For example, the 95 per cent confidence limits for the angular velocities of GEODVEL exclude those of REVEL (Sella et al.) for 34 of the 36 plate pairs that can be formed between any two of the nine plates with the best-constrained motion. The median angular velocity vector difference between GEODVEL and REVEL is 0.028° Myr−1, which is up to 3.1 mm yr−1 on Earth's surface. GEODVEL differs the least from the geodetic angular velocities that Altamimi et al. determine from ITRF2005. GEODVEL's 95 per cent confidence limits exclude 11 of 36 angular velocities of Altamimi et al., and the median difference is 0.015° Myr−1.GEODVEL differs significantly from nearly all relative plate angular velocities averaged over the past few million years, including those of NUVEL-1A. The difference of GEODVEL from updated 3.2 Myr angular velocities is statistically significant for all but two of 36 angular velocities with a median difference of 0.063° Myr−1. Across spreading centres, eight have slowed down while only two have sped up. We conclude that plate angular velocities over the past few decades differ significantly from the corresponding angular velocity averaged over the past 3.2 Myr.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Argus","given":"Donald F."},{"family":"Gordon","given":"Richard G."},{"family":"Heflin","given":"Michael B."},{"family":"Ma","given":"Chopo"},{"family":"Eanes","given":"Richard J."},{"family":"Willis","given":"Pascal"},{"family":"Peltier","given":"W.

  {"id":"Argus.etal_2017_SustainedWater","abstract":"Drought struck California during 7 of the 9 years from 2007 to 2015, reducing the state's available water resources. Pumping of Central Valley groundwater has produced spectacular land subsidence. Uplift of the adjacent Sierra Nevada mountains has been proposed to be either tectonic uplift or solid Earth's elastic response to unloading of Central Valley groundwater. We find that of the 24 mm of uplift of the Sierra Nevada from October 2011 to October 2015, just 5 mm is produced by Central Valley groundwater loss, less than 2 mm is tectonic uplift, and 17 mm is solid Earth's elastic response to water loss in the Sierra Nevada. We invert GPS vertical displacements recording solid Earth's elastic response to infer changes in water storage across the western U.S. from January 2006 to October 2017. We find water changes to be sustained over periods of drought or heavy precipitation: the Sierra Nevada lost 15 ± 19 km3 of water during drought from October 2006 to October 2009, gained 18 ± 14 km3 of water during heavy precipitation from October 2009 to October 2011, and lost 45 ± 21 km3 of water during severe drought from October 2011 to October 2015 (95% confidence limits). Such large changes are not in hydrology models: snow accumulation in October is negligible and long-term soil moisture change is small. We infer that there must be large loss of either deep soil moisture or groundwater in river alluvium and in crystalline basement in the Sierra Nevada. The results suggest there to be parching of water in the ground during the summer of years of drought and seeping of melting snow into the Sierra Nevada in the spring of years of heavy precipitation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Argus","given":"Donald F."},{"family":"Landerer","given":"Felix W."},{"family":"Wiese","given":"David N."},{"family":"Martens","given":"Hilary R."},{"family":"Fu","given":"Yuning"},{"family":"Famiglietti","given":"James S."},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Brian F."},{"family":"Farr","given":"Thomas G."},{"family":"Moore","given":"Angelyn W."},{"family":"Watkins","given":"Michael M."}],"citation-key":"Argus.etal_2017_SustainedWater","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1002/2017JB014424","ISSN":"2169-9356","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC:00116","page":"10,559-10,585","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Sustained Water Loss in California's Mountain Ranges During Severe Drought From 2012 to 2015 Inferred From GPS","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2017JB014424","volume":"122"},
  {"id":"Argus.Gordon_1991_NonetrotationModel","abstract":"We present NNR-NUVEL1, a model of plate velocities relative to the unique reference frame defined by requiring no-net-rotation of the lithosphere while constraining relative plate velocities to equal those in global plate motion model NUVEL-1 [DeMets et al., 1990]. Differences between NNR-NUVEL1 and no-net-rotation plate motion model AM0-2 [Minster and Jordan, 1978] are as large as 15 mm/yr. In NNR-NUVEL1, the Pacific plate rotates in a right-handed sense relative to the no-net-rotation reference frame at 0.67°/m.y. about 63°S, 107°E. This rotation nearly parallels, but is 32% slower than, the Pacific-hotspot Euler vector of HS2-NUVEL1, which is a global model of plate-hotspot velocities constrained to consistency with NUVEL-1 [Gripp and Gordon, 1990]. At Hawaii the Pacific plate moves relative to the no-net-rotation reference frame at 70 mm/yr, which is 25 mm/yr slower than the Pacific plate moves relative to the hotspots. Differences between NNR-NUVEL1 and HS2-NUVEL1 are described completely by a right-handed rotation of 0.33°/m.y. about 49°S, 65°E. The 99% confidence ellipsoids for plate-hotspot motion in model HS2-NUVEL1 exclude the corresponding Euler vectors from model NNR-NUVELl. Thus the no-net-rotation reference frame differs significantly from the hotspot reference frame. If the difference between reference frames is caused by motion of the hotspots relative to a mean mantle reference frame, then hotspots beneath the Pacific plate move with coherent motion towards the east-southeast. Alternatively, the difference between reference frames may show that the uniform drag, no-net-torque reference frame, which is kinematically equivalent to the no-net-rotation reference frame, is based on a dynamically incorrect premise. Possible exceptions to the assumption of uniform drag include a net torque on the lithosphere due to attached subducting slabs and greater resistance to plate motion beneath continents than beneath oceans.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Argus","given":"Donald F."},{"family":"Gordon","given":"Richard G."}],"citation-key":"Argus.Gordon_1991_NonetrotationModel","container-title":"Geophysical Research Letters","DOI":"10.1029/91GL01532","ISSN":"1944-8007","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["1991"]]},"language":"en","page":"2039-2042","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"No-net-rotation model of current plate velocities incorporating plate motion model NUVEL-1","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/91GL01532","volume":"18"},

We use these Euler vectors to estimate present-day stability of the Arabian plate, the rate and direction of extension across the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, and slip rates along the southern Dead Sea fault south of the Lebanon restraining bend (4.5–4.7 ± 0.2 mm/yr, left lateral; 0.8–1.1 ± 0.3 mm/yr extension) and the Owens fracture zone (3.2–2.5 ± 0.5 mm/yr, right lateral, increasing from north to south; 1–2 mm/yr extension). On a broad scale, the Arabian plate has no resolvable internal deformation (weighted root mean square of residual motions for Arabia equals 0.6 mm/yr), although there is marginally significant evidence for N-S shortening in the Palmyride Mountains, Syria at ≤ 1.5 mm/yr. We show that present-day Arabia plate motion with respect to Eurasia is consistent within uncertainties (i.e., ±10%) with plate tectonic estimates since the early Miocene when Arabia separated from Nubia. We estimate the time of Red Sea and Gulf of Aden rifting from present-day Arabia motion, plate tectonic evidence for a 70% increase in Arabia-Nubia relative motion at 13 Ma, and the width of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden and find that rifting initiated roughly simultaneously (±2.2 Myr) along the strike of the Red Sea from the Gulf of Suez to the Afar Triple Junction, as well as along the West Gulf of Aden at 24 ± 2.2 Ma. Based on the present kinematics, we hypothesize that the negative buoyancy of the subducted ocean lithosphere beneath the Makran and the Zagros fold-thrust belt is the principle driver of Arabia-Eurasia convergence and that resisting forces associated with Arabia-Eurasia continental collision have had little impact on plate motion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,24]]},"author":[{"family":"ArRajehi","given":"Abdullah"},{"family":"McClusky","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Reilinger","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Daoud","given":"Mohamed"},{"family":"Alchalbi","given":"Abdulmutaleb"},{"family":"Ergintav","given":"Semih"},{"family":"Gomez","given":"Francisco"},{"family":"Sholan","given":"Jamal"},{"family":"Bou-Rabee","given":"Firyal"},{"family":"Ogubazghi","given":"Ghebrebrhan"},{"family":"Haileab","given":"Biniam"},{"family":"Fisseha","given":"Shimelles"},{"family":"Asfaw","given":"Laike"},{"family":"Mahmoud","given":"Salah"},{"family":"Rayan","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Bendik","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Kogan","given":"Lewis"}],"citation-key":"ArRajehi.etal_2010_GeodeticConstraints","container-title":"Tectonics","DOI":"10.1029/2009TC002482","ISSN":"1944-9194","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC:00190","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Geodetic constraints on present-day motion of the Arabian Plate: Implications for Red Sea and Gulf of Aden rifting","title-short":"Geodetic constraints on present-day motion of the Arabian Plate","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2009TC002482","volume":"29"},

Competing theories for how spreading begins (either by quasi-instantaneous formation of a whole spreading segment or by initiation of spreading at multiple discrete “nodes” separated by thinned continental lithosphere) have been put forward. The major evidence for the nodes theory comes from the Red Sea and geophysical surveys carried out there in the “multi-deeps region” during the 1970’s and 1980’s. We present new high-resolution multibeam bathymetric information over the same region, which, when combined with acoustic backscatter data, seaﬂoor sampling and magmatic geochemical information appears to provide no support for the nodes model. We show that, although the discrete deeps undoubtedly exist, they are not separated from one another by tectonic boundaries but rather represent “windows” onto a continuous spreading axis which is locally inundated and masked by massive slumping of sediments and evaporites from the rift ﬂanks. The geophysical data that was previously used to support the presence of continental crust between the “nodes” can be equally well explained by processes related to the sedimentary blanketing and subsedimentary hydrothermal alteration. A single, “quasi-instantaneous segment formation” model would appear to be all that is required to explain observations from present-day rifting/spreading transitions globally.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Augustin","given":"Nico"},{"family":"Devey","given":"Colin W."},{"family":"Zwan","given":"Froukje M.","non-dropping-particle":"van der"},{"family":"Feldens","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Tominaga","given":"Masako"},{"family":"Bantan","given":"Rashad A."},{"family":"Kwasnitschka","given":"Tom"}],"citation-key":"Augustin.etal_2014_RiftingSpreading","container-title":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","container-title-short":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","DOI":"10.1016/j.epsl.2014.03.047","ISSN":"0012821X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",6]]},"language":"en","page":"217-230","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The rifting to spreading transition in the Red Sea","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0012821X1400199X","volume":"395"},

  {"id":"Avouac_2015_GeodeticImaging","abstract":"Understanding the partitioning of seismic and aseismic fault slip is central to seismotectonics as it ultimately determines the seismic potential of faults. Thanks to advances in tectonic geodesy, it is now possible to develop kinematic models of the spatiotemporal evolution of slip over the seismic cycle and to determine the budget of seismic and aseismic slip. Studies of subduction zones and continental faults have shown that aseismic creep is common and sometimes prevalent within the seismogenic depth range. Interseismic coupling is generally observed to be spatially heterogeneous, deﬁning locked patches of stress accumulation, to be released in future earthquakes or aseismic transients, surrounded by creeping areas. Clay-rich tectonites, high temperature, and elevated pore-ﬂuid pressure seem to be key factors promoting aseismic creep. The generally logarithmic time evolution of afterslip is a distinctive feature of creeping faults that suggests a logarithmic dependency of fault friction on slip rate, as observed in laboratory friction experiments. Most faults can be considered to be paved with interlaced patches where the friction law is either rate-strengthening, inhibiting seismic rupture propagation, or rate-weakening, allowing for earthquake nucleation. The rate-weakening patches act as asperities on which stress builds up in the interseismic period; they might rupture collectively in a variety of ways. The pattern of interseismic coupling can help constrain the return period of the maximummagnitude earthquake based on the requirement that seismic and aseismic slip sum to match long-term slip. Dynamic models of the seismic cycle based on this conceptual model can be tuned to reproduce geodetic and seismological observations. The promise and pitfalls of using such models to assess seismic hazard are discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Avouac","given":"Jean-Philippe"}],"citation-key":"Avouac_2015_GeodeticImaging","container-title":"Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences","container-title-short":"Annu.

  {"id":"Avouac.etal_2014_2013Mw","abstract":"We analyse the Mw 7.7 Balochistan earthquake of 09/24/2013 based on ground surface deformation measured from sub-pixel correlation of Landsat-8 images, combined with back-projection and ﬁnite source modeling of teleseismic waveforms. The earthquake nucleated south of the Chaman strike-slip fault and propagated southwestward along the Hoshab fault at the front of the Kech Band. The rupture was mostly unilateral, propagated at 3 km/s on average and produced a 200 km surface fault trace with purely strike-slip displacement peaking to 10 m and averaging around 6 m. The ﬁnite source model shows that slip was maximum near the surface. Although the Hoshab fault is dipping by 45◦ to the North, in accordance with its origin as a thrust fault within the Makran accretionary prism, slip was nearly purely strike-slip during that earthquake. Large seismic slip on such a non-optimally oriented fault was enhanced possibly due to the inﬂuence of the free surface on dynamic stresses or to particular properties of the fault zone allowing for strong dynamic weakening. Strike-slip faulting on thrust fault within the eastern Makran is interpreted as due to eastward extrusion of the accretionary prism as it bulges out over the Indian plate. Portions of the Makran megathrust, some thrust faults in the Kirthar range and strike-slip faults within the Chaman fault system have been brought closer to failure by this earthquake. Aftershocks cluster within the Chaman fault system north of the epicenter, opposite to the direction of rupture propagation. By contrast, few aftershocks were detected in the area of maximum moment release. In this example, aftershocks cannot be used to infer earthquake characteristics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Avouac","given":"Jean-Philippe"},{"family":"Ayoub","given":"Francois"},{"family":"Wei","given":"Shengji"},{"family":"Ampuero","given":"Jean-Paul"},{"family":"Meng","given":"Lingsen"},{"family":"Leprince","given":"Sebastien"},{"family":"Jolivet","given":"Romain"},{"family":"Duputel","given":"Zacharie"},{"family":"Helmberger","given":"Don"}],"citation-key":"Avouac.etal_2014_2013Mw","container-title":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","container-title-short":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","DOI":"10.1016/j.epsl.2014.01.036","ISSN":"0012821X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",4]]},"language":"en","page":"128-134","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The 2013, Mw 7.7 Balochistan earthquake, energetic strike-slip reactivation of a thrust fault","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0012821X14000521","volume":"391"},

  {"id":"Baer.etal_2008_1995November","abstract":"The 1995 November 22, Mw = 7.2 Nuweiba earthquake occurred along one of the left-stepping segments of the Dead Sea Transform (DST) in the Gulf of Elat (Aqaba). It was the largest earthquake along the DST in at least 160 yr. The main shock was preceded by earthquake swarms north and south of its NE-striking rupture since the early 1980s, and was followed by about 6 months of intense aftershock activity, concentrated mainly northwest and southeast of the main rupture. In this study we re-analyse ERS-1 and ERS-2 InSAR data for the period spanning the main shock and 5 post-seismic years. Because the entire rupture was under the Gulf water, surface observations related to the earthquake are limited to distances greater than 5 km away from the rupture zone. Coseismic interferograms were produced for the earthquake +1 week, +4 months and +6 months. Non-linear inversions were carried out for fault geometry and linear inversions were made for slip distribution using an ascending-descending 2-frame data set. The moment calculated from our best-fitting model is in agreement with the seismological moment, but trade-offs exist among several fault parameters. The present model upgrades previous InSAR models of the Nuweiba earthquake, and differs from recent teleseismic waveform inversion results mainly in terms of slip magnitude and distribution.The moment released by post-seismic deformation in the period of 6 months to 2 yr after the Nuweiba earthquake is about 15 per cent of the coseismic moment release. Our models suggest that this deformation can be represented by slip along the lower part of the coseismic rupture. Localised deformation along the Gulf shores NW of the main rupture in the first 6 months after the earthquake is correlated with surface displacements along active Gulf-parallel normal faults and possibly with shallow M &gt; 3.9, D &lt; 6 km aftershocks. The geodetic moment calculated by modelling this deformation is more than an order of magnitude larger than expected for a single M~ 4 aftershock, but could be a result of a sequence of aftershocks and/or aseismic slip. The major aftershocks and the slip along Gulf-parallel normal faulting NW of the main rupture are associated with positive Coulomb stress changes induced by the main event.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Baer","given":"Gidon"},{"family":"Funning","given":"Gareth J."},{"family":"Shamir","given":"Gadi"},{"family":"Wright","given":"Tim J."}],"citation-key":"Baer.etal_2008_1995November","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","container-title-short":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2008.03901.x","ISSN":"0956-540X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",12,1]]},"page":"1040-1054","source":"Silverchair","title":"The 1995 November 22, Mw 7.2 Gulf of Elat earthquake cycle revisited","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2008.03901.x","volume":"175"},

This includes eruptions from ﬁssures that are oriented both radially and circumferentially with respect to the summit caldera. A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image acquired 1–2 h before the start of a radial ﬁssure eruption in 2009 captures one of these sills in the midst of its propagation toward the surface. Galápagos eruptive ﬁssures of all orientations have previously been presumed to be fed by vertical dikes, and this assumption has guided models of the origin of the eruptive ﬁssure geometry and overall development of the volcanoes. Our ﬁndings allow us to reinterpret the internal structure and evolution of Galápagos volcanoes and of similar basaltic shields. Furthermore, we note that stress changes generated by the emplacement of subhorizontal sills feeding one type of eruption may control the geometry of subsequent eruptive ﬁssures. Speciﬁcally, circumferential ﬁssures tend to open within areas uplifted by sill intrusions that initiated previous radial ﬁssure eruptions. This mechanism provides a possible explanation for the pattern of eruptive ﬁssures that characterizes all the western Galápagos volcanoes, as well as the alternation between radial and circumferential ﬁssure eruptions at Fernandina. The same model suggests that the next eruption of Fernandina will be from a circumferential ﬁssure in the area uplifted by the 2009 sill intrusion, just southwest of the caldera rim.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Bagnardi","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Amelung","given":"Falk"},{"family":"Poland","given":"Michael P."}],"citation-key":"Bagnardi.etal_2013_NewModel","container-title":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","container-title-short":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","DOI":"10.1016/j.epsl.2013.07.016","ISSN":"0012821X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",9]]},"language":"en","page":"358-366","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A new model for the growth of basaltic shields based on deformation of Fernandina volcano, Galápagos Islands","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0012821X13003919","volume":"377-378"},

To truly take advantage of this opportunity, we need to be able to interpret geodetic data in a prompt and robust manner. Here we present a Bayesian approach for the inversion of multiple geodetic data sets that allows a rapid characterization of posterior probability density functions (PDFs) of source model parameters. The inversion algorithm efficiently samples posterior PDFs through a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, incorporating the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, with automatic step size selection. We apply our approach to synthetic geodetic data simulating deformation of magmatic origin and demonstrate its ability to retrieve known source parameters. We also apply the inversion algorithm to interferometric synthetic aperture radar data measuring co-seismic displacements for a thrust-faulting earthquake (2015 Mw 6.4 Pishan earthquake, China) and retrieve optimal source parameters and associated uncertainties. Given its robustness and rapidity in estimating deformation source parameters and uncertainties, our Bayesian framework is capable of taking advantage of real-time geodetic measurements. Thus, our approach can be applied to geodetic data to study magmatic, tectonic, and other geophysical processes, especially in rapid-response operational settings (e.g., volcano observatories). Our algorithm is fully implemented in a MATLAB®-based software package (Geodetic Bayesian Inversion Software) that we make freely available to the scientific community.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Bagnardi","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Hooper","given":"Andrew"}],"citation-key":"Bagnardi.Hooper_2018_InversionSurface","container-title":"Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems","DOI":"10.1029/2018GC007585","ISSN":"1525-2027","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC:00178","page":"2194-2211","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Inversion of Surface Deformation Data for Rapid Estimates of Source Parameters and Uncertainties: A Bayesian Approach","title-short":"Inversion of Surface Deformation Data for Rapid Estimates of Source Parameters and Uncertainties","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018GC007585","volume":"19"},

These orbits are given in a reference frame with respect to which tectonic plates perform a relative motion. Neglecting this motion can cause temporally increasing baseline errors that induce large scale error ramps into the interferometric phase. The amount of error depends on the geographical location and is evaluated globally for the ENVISAT orbit. Predicted biases of deformation estimates can reach up to 7 mm/a in some areas. Whereas these biases are not separable from actual deformation signals by spatio-temporal correlation properties, they are well predictable and can easily be accounted for. A most simple correction approach consists in compensating the plate motion by modifying orbital state vectors, assuming a homogeneous velocity for the whole plate. This approach has been tested on Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) results over the area of Groningen, the Netherlands.","author":[{"family":"Bahr","given":"Hermann"},{"family":"Samiei-Esfahany","given":"Sami"},{"family":"Hanssen","given":"Ramon F"}],"citation-key":"Bahr.etal_2011_EffectReference","container-title":"Proceedings of the Fringe symposium","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",9]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC:00002","page":"8","source":"Zotero","title":"On The Effect of Reference Frame Motion on InSAR Deformation Estimates","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"Bai.etal_OptimizingModel","abstract":"The Shumagin seismic gap along the Alaska Peninsula experienced a major, MW 7.8, interplate thrust earthquake on 22 July 2020. Several available finite-fault inversions indicate patchy slip of up to 4 m at 8 to 48 km depth. There are differences among the models in peak slip and absolute placement of slip on the plate boundary, resulting from differences in data distributions, model parameterizations, and inversion algorithms. Two representative slip models obtained from inversions of large seismic and geodetic data sets produce very different tsunami predictions at tide gauges and deep-water pressure sensors (DART stations), despite having only secondary differences in slip distribution. This is found to be the result of the acute sensitivity of the tsunami excitation for rupture below the continental shelf in proximity to an abrupt shelf break. Iteratively perturbing seismic and geodetic inversions by constraining fault model extent along dip and strike, we obtain an optimal rupture model compatible with teleseismic P and SH waves, regional three-component broadband and strong-motion seismic recordings, hr-GNSS time series and static offsets, as well as tsunami recordings at DART stations and regional and remote tide gauges. Slip is tightly bounded between 25 and 40 km depth, the up-dip limit of slip in the earthquake is resolved to be well-inland of the shelf break, and the rupture extent along strike is well-constrained. The coseismic slip increased Coulomb stress on the shallow plate boundary extending to the trench, but the frictional behavior of the megathrust below the continental slope remains uncertain.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Bai","given":"Yefei"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Chengli"},{"family":"Lay","given":"Thorne"},{"family":"Cheung","given":"Kwok Fai"},{"family":"Ye","given":"Lingling"}],"citation-key":"Bai.etal_OptimizingModel","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/2022JB024484","ISSN":"2169-9356","issue":"n/a","language":"en","page":"e2022JB024484","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Optimizing a model of coseismic rupture for the 22 July 2020 MW 7.8 Simeonof earthquake by exploiting acute sensitivity of tsunami excitation across the shelf break","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2022JB024484","volume":"n/a"},

  {"id":"Barbot_2019_SlowslipSlow","abstract":"The assimilation of geological, geophysical, and laboratory data in physics-based models of fault dynamics promises increasingly realistic simulations of the seismic cycle. To assist this effort, I explore the dynamics of a single velocity-weakening asperity to delineate the relationship between a fault physical properties and the style of faulting during the seismic cycle based on a micro-physical model of rate-and-state friction. From a dimensional analysis, four non-dimensional parameters control the characteristics of slip events and the behavior during the interseismic period, including the Dieterich-Ruina-Rice number Ru, which is proportional to the ratio of asperity to critical nucleation size W/h*, and Rb = (b − a)/b, where a and b control the direct and local evolutionary effects, respectively. For sufficiently large Rb, the Ru number controls the spectrum of fault slip, from periodic slow-slip events to aperiodic fast ruptures. In finite faults, but not in semi-infinite faults, the transition between these end-members includes a bifurcation that involves period-two, period-four, period-six cycles, and deterministic chaos with increasing Ru. Macroscopic fault slip is stabilized as Rb vanishes, even as Ru ≫ 1. For finite faults, but not for semi-infinite faults, the transition between slow and fast ruptures for increasing Rb includes another type of bifurcation with period-two and period-four cycles of slow and fast ruptures. For 0 < Rb ≪ 1 and Ru ≫ 1, slow ruptures become chaotic, characterized by aperiodic bursts of slow earthquakes within a longer slow-slip episode. The third non-dimensional parameter is a cut-off velocity that affects the maximum slip speed. The static friction coefficient μ0 strongly affects the rupture style, as fault strength provides an upper bound for stress drop. Many styles of instabilities and interseismic behaviors emerge depending on the coordinates in phase space, most importantly Ru and Rb. Combining complementary observations at different stages of the seismic cycle may offer an opportunity to infer these parameters in nature.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Barbot","given":"Sylvain"}],"citation-key":"Barbot_2019_SlowslipSlow","container-title":"Tectonophysics","container-title-short":"Tectonophysics","DOI":"10.1016/j.tecto.2019.228171","ISSN":"0040-1951","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,5]]},"language":"en","page":"228171","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Slow-slip, slow earthquakes, period-two cycles, full and partial ruptures, and deterministic chaos in a single asperity fault","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040195119302781","volume":"768"},

  {"id":"Beeler.etal_2020_NearFaultVelocity","abstract":"We compared near-fault velocity spectra recorded during laboratory experiments to that of natural earthquakes. We fractured crystalline rock samples at room temperature and intermediate confining pressure (50 MPa). Subsequent slip events were generated on the fracture surfaces under higher confinement (300 MPa). Velocity spectra from rock fracture resemble the inverse frequency (1/f) decay of natural earthquake velocity. This spectrum can be attributed to fault creation via seismic fracturing over a wide range of spatial scales. In contrast, subsequent slips on the rough fracture surfaces are depleted in high frequency energy and falloff approximately as 1/f2. The 1/f2 spectrum is more consistent with a slider-block model obeying static-kinetic friction than a natural earthquake. The depleted high frequency content precludes the rough fault experiments from being directly analogous to natural sources. The suppression of high frequencies may have resulted from two possible factors: (1) the presence of a well-developed shear zone and coseismic damping of the fault motion by dissipation within it or, in our favored interpretation, (2) a smaller amount of energy dissipated by shearing relative to the total energy release at elevated confining pressure. In context of the latter explanation, a unifying concept that applies to these experiments, earthquakes, ground motion, and models of complex radiated motion is that high frequency radiated energy is relatively enhanced when total energy release is nearly balanced within the source region by dissipative processes. This near-critical energy release condition can be accessed at low normal stress in laboratory experiments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Beeler","given":"N.

  {"id":"Bektas.etal_2024_SeismoturbiditesReveal","abstract":"Although ample historical and paleoseismological information is available on major past earthquakes along the onland part of the Dead Sea Fault, knowledge of the seismic behavior of its southernmost part in the Gulf of Aqaba has remained limited. To fill this gap and improve our understanding of the seismic potential of the submarine faults in the gulf, we analyzed 18 sediment cores ranging in length from 26.8 to 107.3 cm for sedimentary traces of past earthquakes. Radiographic images of the cores reveal numerous well-preserved turbidites intercalated within bioturbated background sediments. In addition, we used magnetic susceptibility, grain-size and µ-XRF data to detect instantaneous deposition in the sedimentary sequence and stratigraphically correlate the cores along the gulf. These results show coevality of some of the turbidites in cores from different basins of the gulf, which we used as the criterion to assign seismic origin for turbidites. In the top ∼1000 years of the sedimentary sequence, where the spatio-stratigraphical correlations are robust, seismo-turbidites caused by the known earthquakes of 1068, 1212, 1588, 1839, and CE 1995 were successfully detected. We found seismo-turbidites triggered by the 1995 earthquake only in the northern half of the gulf, confirming that this part of the fault system ruptured in 1995. On the other hand, the earthquakes in 1068 and CE 1588 triggered turbidites throughout the gulf, indicating that the entire fault system in the gulf was activated during these earthquakes. In addition, we detected seismo-turbidites of the 1212 and CE 1839 earthquakes only locally, suggesting these were smaller earthquakes. One core containing a sedimentary sequence back to ∼1800 BCE shows likely seismo-turbidites around CE 363, 250 BCE, 850 BCE and 1350 BCE. Together with the 1588 and 1068 earthquakes, these older possible seismo-turbidites may indicate a 400–700 (average = 560) year recurrence interval for large earthquakes in the gulf. Absence of significant turbidites in the southern gulf since CE 1588 therefore implies that this part of the fault system could be a candidate for a large earthquake in the near future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Bektaş","given":"Zeynep"},{"family":"Avşar","given":"Ulaş"},{"family":"Ribot","given":"Matthieu"},{"family":"Klinger","given":"Yann"},{"family":"Jónsson","given":"Sigurjón"}],"citation-key":"Bektas.etal_2024_SeismoturbiditesReveal","container-title":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","container-title-short":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","DOI":"10.1016/j.epsl.2024.118595","ISSN":"0012-821X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,1]]},"page":"118595","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Seismo-turbidites reveal locations of major earthquakes during the past millennium in the Gulf of Aqaba, southern Dead Sea Fault","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X24000293","volume":"629"},
  {"id":"Ben-Avraham_1985_StructuralFramework","abstract":"The Gulf of Elat (Aqaba) occupies the southern part of the Dead Sea rift. The rift is considered to be a plate boundary of the transform type (partially leaky) which connects seafloor spreading in the Red Sea with the Sagros-Taurus zone of continental collision. The deep water in the Gulf of Elat, up to 1850 m, provides a rare opportunity to examine the process of continental rifting by marine geophysical techniques. The bathymetry alone provides much information about fault patterns in this area. The fragmentation of the once continuous Arabian-African platform is a complicated process. It shapes the structure of the gulf which has developed through continuing tectonism, primarily consisting of faulting. Recent geophysical and geological studies of the Gulf of Elat including bathymetry, bottom photographs, continuous seismic profiles, seismic refraction, gravity, magnetics, heat flow, and coring provide new information about the shallow and deep crustal structure of this important segment of the world rift system. The shallow structure of the gulf is dominated by three elongated en echelon basins, which strike N20°–25°E. Undulations in the floors of the basins produce several distinct deeps. These basins are interpreted as pullaparts. The new data from the gulf suggest that classical models for the formation of these structures should be modified. Only one of the longitudinal faults of each depression is a strike-slip fault, while the other is predominantly a normal fault. The situation with the other two sides of the basin which are supposed to be composed of normal faults may also be more complex than previously thought. At least in one case, one such boundary is composed of a strike-slip fault while the other has no significant fault. Crustal models of the Gulf of Elat based on gravity data indicate that the basins are rather shallow and do not extend into the lower crust. The fill of the basins extends to about 5 km below the seafloor in. the northern and southern basins and less in the central basin. Most significant magnetic anomalies in the Gulf of Elat extend from land into the sea. None of them, however, extends from one coast to another across the gulf. This supports the geological evidence for a shear between the Arabia and Sinai plates. The magnetic field over the southern third of the gulf is rather smooth and markedly different from that of the other parts. The nature of the magnetics, the crustal structure of the western margin, and the heat flow values indicate a thinner crust and different tectonic processes in the southern part of the gulf. Overall, it seems that within the southern Gulf of Elat a transition occurs between crustal spreading that takes place in the Red Sea to a rifting without spreading that takes place along the Dead Sea transform. Spreading activity propagates from south to north. The most active place is the central basin which is being propagated northward into the shallow northern basin.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Ben-Avraham","given":"Zvi"}],"citation-key":"Ben-Avraham_1985_StructuralFramework","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/JB090iB01p00703","ISSN":"2156-2202","issue":"B1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1985"]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC:00287","page":"703-726","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Structural framework of the Gulf of Elat (AQABA), Northern Red Sea","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JB090iB01p00703","volume":"90"},

Its floor is up to 1850 m deep, about 4 km below the neighbouring mountains on land. The Gulf occupies a fault-controlled depression, partly filled by sediments. The structure of the Gulf is dominated by en-echelon faults which delimit three elongated basins that strike N20–25°E. Sedimentation in these basins was syn-tectonic. Their fill consists of turbidities and, pelagic deposits. The recorded thicknesses reach 2–3 km, without reaching basement. The fill extends to more than 7 km below adjacent lands when corrected for erosion. In parts of the basins deformation was fast enough relative to sedimentation as to deform the seafloor. Flexures, arches and small folds were formed. In the southern part of the Gulf sharp upright folds, which form prominent hills, may be of diapiric origin. The basins are flanked by marginal blocks, which are much wider on the western side of the Gulf of Elat than on its eastern side, which consists of a very steep slope. The marginal blocks on the west sometimes form topographic terraces. Alluvial fans and submarine cones are conspicuous on the west side of the Gulf, but are virtually absent on the east side. It seems that the present shape of the Gulf was acquired during the last stage of movement on the Dead Sea rift, when left lateral slip of about 40–50 km took place. Tectonism was strongest in the basins and on the faults which flank them, but the marginal blocks are also involved in active tectonism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Ben-Avraham","given":"Zvi"},{"family":"Almagor","given":"Gideon"},{"family":"Garfunkel","given":"Zvi"}],"citation-key":"Ben-Avraham.etal_1979_SedimentsStructure","collection-title":"New Aspects of Sedimentation in Small Ocean Basins","container-title":"Sedimentary Geology","container-title-short":"Sedimentary Geology","DOI":"10.1016/0037-0738(79)90016-2","ISSN":"0037-0738","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1979",7,1]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC:00207","page":"239-267","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Sediments and structure of the Gulf of Elat (Aqaba)—Northern Red Sea","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0037073879900162","volume":"23"},
  {"id":"Ben-Zion.etal_2003_LargeEarthquake","abstract":"We analyze evolving stress and seismicity generated by three realizations of a discrete model of a strike-slip fault in a three-dimensional (3-D) elastic half space using five functions of stress and five functions of seismicity. The first model (F) has realistic dynamic weakening (static minus dynamic frictions), the second (FC) has zero critical dynamic weakening, and the third (SYS) is constrained to produce only system size events. The results for model F show cyclical development, saturation, and destruction of fluctuations and long-range correlations on the fault, punctuated by the system size events. The development stage involves evolution of stress and seismicity to distributions having broad ranges of scales, evolution of response functions toward scale-invariant behavior, increasing seismicity rate and event sizes, and increasing hypocenter diffusion. Most functions reach asymptotically stable values around 2/3 of the cycle and then fluctuate until one event cascades to become the next large earthquake. In model FC the above evolution is replaced by scale-invariant statistical fluctuations, while in model SYS the signals show simple cyclic behavior. The results suggest that large earthquake cycles on heterogeneous faults with realistic positive dynamic weakening are associated with intermittent criticality, produced by spontaneous evolution of stress heterogeneities toward a critical level of disorder having a broad range of scales. The stress evolution and development of large earthquake cycles may be tracked with seismicity functions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Ben-Zion","given":"Yehuda"},{"family":"Eneva","given":"Mariana"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yunfeng"}],"citation-key":"Ben-Zion.etal_2003_LargeEarthquake","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/2002JB002121","ISSN":"2156-2202","issue":"B6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003"]]},"language":"en","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Large earthquake cycles and intermittent criticality on heterogeneous faults due to evolving stress and seismicity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2002JB002121","volume":"108"},
  {"id":"Ben-Zion.Lyakhovsky_2006_AnalysisAftershocks","abstract":"We perform analytical and numerical studies of aftershock sequences following abrupt steps of strain in a rheologically layered model of the lithosphere. The model consists of a weak sedimentary layer, over a seismogenic zone governed by a viscoelastic damage rheology, underlain by a viscoelastic upper mantle. The damage rheology accounts for fundamental irreversible aspects of brittle rock deformation and is constrained by laboratory data of fracture and friction experiments. A 1-D version of the viscoelastic damage rheology leads to an exponential analytical solution for aftershock rates. The corresponding solution for a 3-D volume is expected to be sum of exponentials. The exponential solution depends primarily on a material parameter R given by the ratio of timescale for damage increase to timescale for accumulation of gradual inelastic deformation, and to a lesser extent on the initial damage and a threshold strain state for material degradation. The parameter R is also inversely proportional to the degree of seismic coupling across the fault. Simplifying the governing equations leads to a solution following the modiﬁed Omori power-law decay with an analytical exponent p = 1. In addition, the results associated with the general exponential expression can be ﬁtted for various values of R with the modiﬁed Omori law. The same holds for the decay rates of aftershocks simulated numerically using the 3-D layered lithospheric model. The results indicate that low R values (e.g. R ≤ 1) corresponding to cold brittle material produce long Omori-type aftershock sequences with high event productivity, while high R values (e.g. R ≥ 5) corresponding to hot viscous material produce short diffuse response with low event productivity. The frequency-size statistics of aftershocks simulated in 3-D cases with low R values follow the Gutenberg–Richter power law relation, while events simulated for high R values are concentrated in a narrow magnitude range. Increasing thickness of the weak sedimentary cover produces results that are similar to those associated with higher R values. Increasing the assumed geothermal gradient reduces the depth extent of the simulated earthquakes. The magnitude of the largest simulated aftershocks is compatible with the Ba˚th law for a range of values of a dynamic damage-weakening parameter. The results provide a physical basis for interpreting the main observed features of aftershock sequences in terms of basic structural and material properties.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Ben-Zion","given":"Yehuda"},{"family":"Lyakhovsky","given":"Vladimir"}],"citation-key":"Ben-Zion.Lyakhovsky_2006_AnalysisAftershocks","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2006.02878.x","ISSN":"0956540X, 1365246X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",4]]},"language":"en","page":"197-210","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Analysis of aftershocks in a lithospheric model with seismogenic zone governed by damage rheology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/gji/article-lookup/doi/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2006.02878.x","volume":"165"},

  {"id":"Bertelsen.etal_2021_ElasticityAre","abstract":"Geodetic modelling has become an established procedure to interpret the dynamics of active volcanic plumbing systems and magma transfer within the crust. Most established geodetic models implemented for inverting geodetic data share similar physical assumptions: (1) the Earth's crust is modelled as an inﬁnite, homogeneous elastic half-space with a ﬂat surface, (2) there is no anisotropic horizontal stress to simulate tectonic stresses, (3) the source boundary conditions are kinematic, i.e. they account for an instantaneous inﬂation or deﬂation of the source. Field and geophysical observations, however, provide evidence that signiﬁcant inelastic shear deformation of the host rock can accommodate the propagation of dykes and sills. We show that inelastic processes accommodating the emplacement of dykes in the brittle crust have large implications for dyke-induced surface deformation patterns. We present two quantitative laboratory experiments of dyke emplacement, during which the syn-emplacement surface deformation is monitored. In one experiment, the host material is elastic gelatine, whereas in the other experiment the host material is cohesive Coulomb, plastic silica ﬂour. Even if both experiments produce sub-vertical dykes of similar shapes, their emplacement mechanisms and their associated surface deformation strongly differ. In the gelatine experiment, the dyke propagates as a tensile fracture in a dominantly elastic host, and the surface deformation exhibits two uplifting bulges separated by a trough parallel to, and above the apex of, the underlying dyke. Conversely, in the silica ﬂour experiment, the dyke propagates as viscous indenter through a dominantly plastic host, and the surface deformation exhibits a single uplifting area that narrows through time. The comparison of our experiments shows that (1) plastic deformation (e.g., shear failure, compaction) of the host has large effects on dyke-induced surface deformation patterns and needs to be considered in geodetic models, and (2) dyke emplacement mechanisms matter in geodetic modelling, strongly suggesting that commonly used kinematic geodetic models such as the opening rectangular dislocation model (Okada 1985) are limited for revealing the physics and dynamics of volcano plumbing systems.

By mapping small amounts of ground deformation over large spatial areas, InSAR has the potential to produce continental-scale maps of strain accumulation on active faults. However, most InSAR studies to date have focused on areas where the coherence is relatively good (e.g. California, Tibet and Turkey) and most analysis techniques (stacking, small baseline subset algorithm, permanent scatterers, etc.) only include information from pixels which are coherent throughout the time-span of the study. In some areas, such as Alaska, where the deformation rate is small and coherence very variable, it is necessary to include information from pixels which are coherent in some but not all interferograms. We use a three-stage iterative algorithm based on distributed scatterer interferometry. We validate our method using synthetic data created using realistic parameters from a test site on the Denali Fault, Alaska, and present a preliminary result of 10.5 ± 5.0 mm yr−1 for the slip rate on the Denali Fault based on a single track of radar data from ERS1/2.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Biggs","given":"Juliet"},{"family":"Wright","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Zhong"},{"family":"Parsons","given":"Barry"}],"citation-key":"Biggs.etal_2007_MultiinterferogramMethod","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","container-title-short":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2007.03415.x","ISSN":"0956-540X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",9,1]]},"page":"1165-1179","source":"Silverchair","title":"Multi-interferogram method for measuring interseismic deformation: Denali Fault, Alaska","title-short":"Multi-interferogram method for measuring interseismic deformation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2007.03415.x","volume":"170"},

Satellite imagery covers volcanoes globally throughout their eruptive cycles, independent of ground-based monitoring, providing a multidecadal archive suitable for probabilistic analysis linking deformation with eruption. Here we show that, of the 198 volcanoes systematically observed for the past 18 years, 54 deformed, of which 25 also erupted. For assessing eruption potential, this high proportion of deforming volcanoes that also erupted (46%), together with the proportion of non-deforming volcanoes that did not erupt (94%), jointly represent indicators with ‘strong’ evidential worth. Using a larger catalogue of 540 volcanoes observed for 3 years, we demonstrate how this eruption–deformation relationship is influenced by tectonic, petrological and volcanic factors. Satellite technology is rapidly evolving and routine monitoring of the deformation status of all volcanoes from space is anticipated, meaning probabilistic approaches will increasingly inform hazard decisions and strategic development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Biggs","given":"J."},{"family":"Ebmeier","given":"S.

A few boundaries are newly interpreted from topography, volcanism, and/or seismicity, taking into account relative plate velocities from magnetic anomalies, moment tensor solutions, and/or geodesy. In addition to the 14 large plates whose motion was described by the NUVEL-1A poles (Africa, Antarctica, Arabia, Australia, Caribbean, Cocos, Eurasia, India, Juan de Fuca, Nazca, North America, Pacific, Philippine Sea, South America), model PB2002 includes 38 small plates (Okhotsk, Amur, Yangtze, Okinawa, Sunda, Burma, Molucca Sea, Banda Sea, Timor, Birds Head, Maoke, Caroline, Mariana, North Bismarck, Manus, South Bismarck, Solomon Sea, Woodlark, New Hebrides, Conway Reef, Balmoral Reef, Futuna, Niuafo'ou, Tonga, Kermadec, Rivera, Galapagos, Easter, Juan Fernandez, Panama, North Andes, Altiplano, Shetland, Scotia, Sandwich, Aegean Sea, Anatolia, Somalia), for a total of 52 plates. No attempt is made to divide the Alps-Persia-Tibet mountain belt, the Philippine Islands, the Peruvian Andes, the Sierras Pampeanas, or the California-Nevada zone of dextral transtension into plates; instead, they are designated as “orogens” in which this plate model is not expected to be accurate. The cumulative-number/area distribution for this model follows a power law for plates with areas between 0.002 and 1 steradian. Departure from this scaling at the small-plate end suggests that future work is very likely to define more very small plates within the orogens. The model is presented in four digital files: a set of plate boundary segments; a set of plate outlines; a set of outlines of the orogens; and a table of characteristics of each digitization step along plate boundaries, including estimated relative velocity vector and classification into one of 7 types (continental convergence zone, continental transform fault, continental rift, oceanic spreading ridge, oceanic transform fault, oceanic convergent boundary, subduction zone).

  {"id":"Bird.etal_2009_LinearNonlinear","abstract":"Relationships between relative plate velocity and seismicity differ by plate-boundary class. We test the null hypothesis of linearity of earthquake rates with velocity in each of seven classes. A linear relationship is expected if earthquake rate is proportional to seismic moment rate, which is proportional to relative plate velocity. To reduce bias by aftershocks and swarms, we estimate independence probabilities of earthquakes and use them as weights. We assign shallow earthquakes to boundary steps and classes, then sort boundary steps within each class by velocity and plot cumulative earthquakes against cumulative model moment rate. We use two measures of nonlinearity and 104 stochastic simulations to assess significance. In subduction zones the relationship between seismicity and velocity is nonlinear with 99.9% confidence. Slower subduction at < 66 mm=a (producing 35% of tectonic moment under the null hypothesis) produces only 20% of subduction earthquakes. Continental convergent boundaries display similar nonlinearity (P < 0:001 for the null hypothesis). Ocean spreading ridges show seismicity decreasing with velocity. Oceanic transform faults and oceanic convergent boundaries show marginal nonlinearity (P < 0:01; P < 0:05). Continental rifts and continental transform faults follow the null hypothesis. Three effects may contribute to velocity dependence in subduction: (1) the brittle/ductile transition at a critical temperature is advected deeper by faster underthrusting; (2) subducted sediment is viscous, so lower stresses in slower boundaries discourage earthquakes; (3) pore pressures increase with velocity, encouraging frictional failure. Mechanism (1) has only minor effects on earthquake productivity, but mechanisms (2) and (3) could be important.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Bird","given":"P."},{"family":"Kagan","given":"Y.

To better estimate the seismic hazard associated with these two faults, we jointly invert interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and GPS data to image the spatial distribution of interseismic coupling along the eastern part of both the NAF and EAF. We perform the inversion in a Bayesian framework, enabling to estimate uncertainties on both long-term relative plate motion and coupling. We find that coupling is high and deep (0–20 km) on the NAF and heterogeneous and superficial (0–5 km) on the EAF.

In addition, the underlying physics of such predictions is poorly understood. Here, we address scalability using a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN). Our model encodes fault physics in the deep learning loss function using time-lapse ultrasonic data.

  {"id":"Branney_1995_DownsagExtension","abstract":"Structures at calderas may form as a result of precursory tumescence, subsidence due withdrawal of magmatic support, resurgence, and regional tectonism. Structural reactivation and overprinting are common. To explore which types of structures may derive directly from subsidence without other factors, evidence is reviewed from pits caused by the melting of buried ice blocks, mining subsidence, scaled subsidence models, and from over 50 calderas. This review suggests that complex patterns of peripheral deformation, with multiple ring and arcuate fractures both inside and outside caldera rims, topographic embayments, arcuate graben, and concentric zones of extension and compression may form as a direct result of subsidence and do not require a complex subsidence and inflation history. Downsag is a feature of many calderas and it does not indicate subsidence on an inward-dipping ring fault, as has been inferred previously. Where magmatic inflation is absent or slight, initial arcuate faults formed during collapse are likely to be multiple, and dip outwards to vertical. Associated downsag causes the peripheries of calderas undergo radial (centripetal) extension, and this accounts for some of the complex peripheral fractures, arcuate crevasses, graben, and some topographic moats. The structural boundary of a caldera, defined here as the outermost limits of subsidence and related deformation including downsag, commonly lies outside ring faults and outside the embayed topographic wall. It is likely to be funnel-shaped, i.e. inward-dipping, even though ring and arcuate fractures within it may dip outward. Inward-dipping arcuate normal faults at shallow levels and steep inward-dipping contacts between a caldera's fill and walls may both occur at a caldera that has initially subsided on outward-dipping ring faults. They arise due to peripheral surficial extension, gravitational spreading and scarp collapse. Topographic enlargement at some calderas and the formation of embayments may reflect general progressive downsag and localized downsag, respectively. These processes may occur in addition to surficial degradation of oversteep ring-fault scarps.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Branney","given":"M.

We propose both a uniform nomenclature and an alternative approach to the standard 3D decomposition problem using the concept of a strap-down reference system.","author":[{"family":"Brouwer","given":"Wietske S."},{"family":"Hanssen","given":"Ramon F."}],"citation-key":"Brouwer.Hanssen_2021_AnalysisInsar","container-title":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","DOI":"10.1109/IGARSS47720.2021.9554216","event-title":"2021 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS","ISSN":"2153-7003","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7]]},"page":"2927-2930","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"An Analysis of Insar Displacement Vector Decomposition Fallacies and the Strap-Down Solution","type":"paper-conference"},
  {"id":"Brouwer.Hanssen_2023_TreatiseInSAR","abstract":"The estimation of displacement vectors for (objects on) the Earth’s surface using satellite InSAR requires geometric transformations of the observables based on orbital viewing geometries. Usually, there are insufficient viewing geometries available for full 3-D reconstruction, leading to nonunique solutions. Currently, there is no standardized approach to deal with this problem, resulting in products that are based on haphazard and/or oversimplified assumptions with biased estimates and reduced interpretability. Here, we show that a clear definition of—and subsequent adherence to—enabling conditions guarantees the validity and quality of displacement vector estimates leading to standardized interferometric products with improved interpretability. We introduce the concept of the null line as a key metric for InSAR geometry and bias estimation, assess its impact and orientation for all positions on Earth, and propose a novel reference system that is inherently unbiased. We evaluate current operational practice, leading to a taxonomy of frequently encountered misconceptions and to recommendations for InSAR product generation and interpretation. We also propose new subscript notation to uniquely distinguish different projection and decomposition products. Our propositions contribute to further standardization of InSAR product definition, improved map annotation, and robust interpretability.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Brouwer","given":"Wietske S."},{"family":"Hanssen","given":"Ramon F."}],"citation-key":"Brouwer.Hanssen_2023_TreatiseInSAR","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","DOI":"10.1109/TGRS.2023.3322595","ISSN":"1558-0644","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"page":"1-11","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"A Treatise on InSAR Geometry and 3-D Displacement Estimation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10273425","volume":"61"},

  {"id":"Burchardt.Walter_2010_PropagationLinkage","abstract":"The formation of ring faults yields important implications for understanding the structural and dynamic evolution of collapse calderas and potentially associated ash-flow eruptions. Caldera collapse occurred in 2000 at Miyakejima Island (Japan) in response to a lateral intrusion. Based on geophysical data it is inferred that a set of caldera ring faults was propagating upward. To understand the kinematics of ring-fault propagation, linkage, and interaction, we describe new laboratory sand-box experiments that were analyzed through Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and post-processed using 2D strain analysis. The results help us gain a better understanding of the processes occurring during caldera subsidence at Miyakejima. We show that magma chamber evacuation induces strain localization at the lateral chamber margin in the form of a set of reverse faults that sequentially develops and propagates upwards. Then a set of normal faults initiates from tension fractures at the surface, propagating downwards to link with the reverse faults at depth. With increasing amounts of subsidence, interaction between the reverse- and normal-fault segments results in a deactivation of the reverse faults, while displacement becomes focused on the outer normal faults. Modeling results show that the area of faulting and collapse migrates successively outward, as peak displacement transfers from the inner ring faults to later developed outer ring faults. The final structural architecture of the faults bounding the subsiding piston-like block is hence a consequence of the amount of subsidence, in agreement with other caldera structures observed in nature. The experimental simulations provide an analogy to the observations and seismic records of caldera collapse at Miyakejima volcano, but are also applicable to caldera collapse in general.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",2,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Burchardt","given":"Steffi"},{"family":"Walter","given":"Thomas R."}],"citation-key":"Burchardt.Walter_2010_PropagationLinkage","container-title":"Bulletin of Volcanology","container-title-short":"Bull Volcanol","DOI":"10.1007/s00445-009-0321-7","ISSN":"0258-8900, 1432-0819","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"297-308","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Propagation, linkage, and interaction of caldera ring-faults: comparison between analogue experiments and caldera collapse at Miyakejima, Japan, in 2000","title-short":"Propagation, linkage, and interaction of caldera ring-faults","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00445-009-0321-7","volume":"72"},

  {"id":"Burgmann_2018_GeophysicsGeology","abstract":"Modern geodetic and seismologic observations describe the behavior of fault slip over a vast range of spatial and temporal scales. Slip at sub-seismogenic speeds is evident from top to bottom of lithospheric faults and plays an important role throughout the earthquake cycle. Where earthquakes and tremor accompany slow slip, they help illuminate the spatiotemporal evolution of fault slip. Geophysical subsurface imaging and geologic field studies provide information about suitable environments of slow slip. In particular, exhumed fault and shear zones from various depths reveal the importance of multiple deformation processes and fault-zone structures. Most geologic examples feature frictionally weak and velocity-strengthening materials, well-developed mineral fabrics, and abundant veining indicative of near-lithostatic fluid pressure. To produce transient slow slip events and tremor, in addition to the presence of high-pressure fluids a heterogeneous fault-zone structure, composition, and/or metamorphic assemblage may be needed. Laboratory and computational models suggest that velocity-weakening slip patches smaller than a critical dimension needed for earthquake nucleation will also fail in slow slip events. Changes in fluid pressure or slip rate can cause a fault to transition between stable and unstable fault slip behavior. Future interdisciplinary investigations of slow fault slip, directly integrating geophysical, geological and modeling investigations, will further improve our understanding of the dynamics of slow slip and aid in providing more accurate earthquake hazard characterizations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Bürgmann","given":"Roland"}],"citation-key":"Burgmann_2018_GeophysicsGeology","container-title":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","container-title-short":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","DOI":"10.1016/j.epsl.2018.04.062","ISSN":"0012-821X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"112-134","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The geophysics, geology and mechanics of slow fault slip","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X18302760","volume":"495"},

Inversions for the distribution of aseismic slip rate along the ∼15°NW dipping underthrust suggest a nonslipping plate interface in southern Kamchatka above ∼50 km depth, along the segment that ruptured in the Mw = 9, 1952 earthquake. North of ∼53°N, the subduction interface experiences significant aseismic slip, consistent with the lower seismic moment release in M ≤ 8.5 earthquakes along this portion of the subduction zone. The GPS velocities are consistent with a boundary element forward model in which historic earthquake rupture zones are represented as locked asperities, surrounded by a zero shear stress subduction interface loaded by plate convergence. Models in which the complete rupture zones of historic earthquakes are considered locked greatly overpredict the degree of kinematic coupling. Reducing the area of the locked model asperities to the central 25% area of historic rupture zones fits the data well, suggesting that large earthquakes involve small fully locked core asperities surrounded by conditionally stable portions of the plate interface. Areas of low aseismic slip rate appear to be roughly correlated with areas of low isostatic gravity anomalies over offshore forearc basins, while less coupled portions of the Kamchatka subduction zone coincide with high-gravity anomalies offshore of two peninsulas, possibly related to the subduction of the Emperor-Meji seamount chain and the Kruzenstern fracture zone.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Bürgmann","given":"Roland"},{"family":"Kogan","given":"Mikhail G."},{"family":"Steblov","given":"Grigory M."},{"family":"Hilley","given":"George"},{"family":"Levin","given":"Vasily E."},{"family":"Apel","given":"Edwin"}],"citation-key":"Burgmann.etal_2005_InterseismicCoupling","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/2005JB003648","ISSN":"2156-2202","issue":"B7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"language":"en","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Interseismic coupling and asperity distribution along the Kamchatka subduction zone","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2005JB003648","volume":"110"},

La cumbre volcano is one of the most active volcanoes in the Galapagos archipelago and is situated closest to the mantle plume. Eruptions are frequent here, with a record of 30 eruptions since 1800. Recently La Cumbre volcano erupted on 2020 January 12, with 11 seismic tremors recorded on that day with a maximum magnitude of 4.7.

It is one of the best approaches for monitoring and analyzing surface deformations from space with a millimeter level of accuracy. In this paper, we analyze the January 2020 eruption of the La cumbre volcano using the SBAS technique. 9 Sentinel-1C band SAR data granules from 2019 November 17 to 2020 February 21 were used to generate the deformation time series map for estimating the degree of deformation at the volcanic edifice.

  {"id":"Cao.etal_2021_AdvancedInSAR","abstract":"Tropospheric delays are still the main error source of satellite-based Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) mapping of Earth’s surface movements. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of global atmospheric models (GAMs) in reducing InSAR tropospheric delays. However, the importance of appropriate interpolation and weighting strategies in GAM corrections has largely been overlooked. Here we present a new GAM-based tropospheric correction method that incorporates spatial stochastic models of the troposphere into the weighting strategy of the correction. The method determines the correlation between a pixel of interest and neighboring GAM grid locations (3D) according to the spatial variability of the tropospheric random field, instead of subjectively using an inverse distance method, a local spline function, or other standard interpolation scheme. Also, our new method considers horizontal heterogeneities of the tropospheric field by estimating the integral of the tropospheric delays along the satellite line-of-sight (LOS) direction, instead of calculating projected zenith-delays. The method can be used with any GAM, but we here implement it with the latest ECMWF (European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) ERA5 reanalysis products. We validate the new method with hundreds of Sentinel-1 images from 2015 to 2020 over the island of Hawaii, a location with variable topography, surface conditions, local climate, and deformation, and explore the tropospheric corrections for both interferograms and time-series analysis products (deformation velocities and time-series solutions). Compared with other GAM corrections (PyAPS, d-LOS, and GACOS), our new method yields a larger reduction of the average standard deviation of the corrected interferograms, i.e., from 2.55 to 1.91 cm, instead of 2.47 cm (PyAPS), 2.44 cm (d-LOS), and 2.10 cm (GACOS). Also, a larger fraction of 87% of the interferograms (243 out of 280) is improved, compared with 52%, 53%, and 66% for the other GAM corrections, respectively. These results demonstrate the importance of considering (1) tropospheric stochastic models in GAM corrections, (2) horizontal heterogeneities when estimating the LOS delays, and (3) tropospheric delays when mapping long-wavelength or small-magnitude deformations using InSAR.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Cao","given":"Yunmeng"},{"family":"Jónsson","given":"Sigurjón"},{"family":"Li","given":"Zhiwei"}],"citation-key":"Cao.etal_2021_AdvancedInSAR","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/2020JB020952","ISSN":"2169-9356","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC:00015","page":"e2020JB020952","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Advanced InSAR Tropospheric Corrections From Global Atmospheric Models that Incorporate Spatial Stochastic Properties of the Troposphere","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020JB020952","volume":"126"},

While this deformation is mostly steady over multiple years, it is modulated by smaller-scale transient deformation associated with, for example, earthquakes, volcanic unrest, and geothermal exploitation. Here, we combine countrywide Sentinel-1 interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data (from six tracks) from 2015 to 2021 with continuous Global Navigation Satellite System observations to produce time series of displacements across Iceland. The InSAR results were improved in a two-step tropospheric mitigation procedure, using (a) global atmospheric models to reduce long-wavelength and topography-correlated tropospheric signals, and (b) modeling of the stochastic properties of the residual troposphere. Our results significantly improve upon earlier countrywide InSAR results, which were based on InSAR stacking, as we use more data, better data weighting, and advanced InSAR corrections to produce time series of ground displacements instead of just velocities. We fuse the three ascending and three descending track results to estimate maps of East and Up velocities, which clearly show the large-scale extension and GIA deformation. Using revised plate-spreading and GIA models, based on these new ground velocity maps, we remove the large-scale and steady deformation from the InSAR time series and analyze the remaining transient deformations.

  {"id":"Cattania.Segall_2021_PrecursorySlow","abstract":"Foreshocks are not uncommon prior to large earthquakes, but their physical mechanism remains controversial. Two interpretations have been advanced: (1) foreshocks are driven by aseismic nucleation and (2) foreshocks are cascades, with each event triggered by earlier ones. Here, we study seismic cycles on faults with fractal roughness at wavelengths exceeding the nucleation length. We perform 2-D quasi-dynamic, elastic simulations of frictionally uniform rate-state faults. Roughness leads to a range of slip behavior between system-size ruptures, including widespread creep, localized slow slip, and microseismicity. These processes are explained by spatial variations in normal stress (σ) caused by roughness: regions with low σ tend to creep, while high σ regions remain locked until they break seismically. Foreshocks and mainshocks both initiate from the rupture of locked asperities, but mainshocks preferentially start on stronger asperities. The preseismic phase is characterized by feedback between creep and foreshocks: episodic seismic bursts break groups of nearby asperities, causing creep to accelerate, which in turns loads other asperities leading to further foreshocks. A simple analytical treatment of this mutual stress transfer, confirmed by simulations, predicts slip velocities and seismicity rates increase as 1/t, where t is the time to the mainshock. The model reproduces the observed migration of foreshocks toward the mainshock hypocenter, foreshock locations consistent with static stress changes, and the 1/t acceleration in stacked catalogs. Instead of interpreting foreshocks as either driven by coseismic stress changes or by creep, we propose that earthquake nucleation on rough faults is driven by the feedback between the two.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Cattania","given":"Camilla"},{"family":"Segall","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"Cattania.Segall_2021_PrecursorySlow","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","container-title-short":"J Geophys Res Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/2020JB020430","ISSN":"2169-9313, 2169-9356","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC:00044","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Precursory Slow Slip and Foreshocks on Rough Faults","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020JB020430","volume":"126"},

An eruptive crisis with two episodes occurred during the 3 years between the surveys. We modeled the displacements from the photogrammetric surveys using a three?dimensional mixed boundary element method. The model shows that both eruptive episodes were fed by a single dike oriented 165° from north. As the dike approached the ground surface, it divided into segments that rotated into an en echelon pattern.

  {"id":"Chambon.etal_2006_FrictionalResponse","abstract":"On the basis of experimental results, we propose a new friction law aiming at describing the mechanical behavior of thick gouge layers. As shown in the companion paper, the dominant effect to take into account is a significant slip-weakening process active over decimetric slip distances. This slip weakening is strongly nonlinear and, formerly, does not involve any characteristic length scale. The decrease of the gouge friction coefficient μ with imposed slip δ is well modeled by a power law: μ = μ0 + αδ−β, with β = 0.4. On this major trend are superimposed second-order velocity-weakening and time-strengthening effects. These effects can be described using classical rate- and state-dependent friction (RSF) laws and are associated with a small length scale dc ≈ 100 μm. Consistent with the general RSF framework, we combine slip-weakening and second-order effects in a slip, rate, and state (SRS) friction law with two state variables. We then compute the fracture (or breakdown) energy Gc and the apparent weakening distance Dcapp associated with the slip-weakening process. Once extrapolated to realistic “geophysical” confining pressures, the obtained values are in excellent agreement with those inferred from real earthquakes: Gc ≈ 5 × 106 J m−2 and Dcapp ≈ 20 cm.

For this purpose, we use satellite data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment to determine the time evolution of surface loading. We compute the expected geodetic deformation assuming a perfectly elastic Earth model. We consider Green's functions, describing the surface deformation response to a point load, for an elastic homogeneous half-space model and for a layered nonrotating spherical Earth model based on the Preliminary Reference Earth Model and a local seismic velocity model. The amplitude and phase of the seasonal variation of the vertical and horizontal geodetic positions can be jointly adjusted only with the layered Earth model, while an elastic half-space model fails, emphasizing the importance of using a realistic Earth elastic structure to model surface displacements induced by surface loading. We demonstrate, based on a formal inversion, that the fit to the geodetic data can be improved by adjusting the layered Earth model. Therefore, the study also shows that the modeling of geodetic seasonal variations provides a way to probe the elastic structure of the Earth, even in the absence of direct measurements of surface load variations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Chanard","given":"K."},{"family":"Avouac","given":"J.

The large 1992–2011 SAR data set permits evaluation of short- and long-wavelength deformation larger than 2 mm/yr without alignment of the velocity ﬁeld to a GPS-based model. Our time series approach in which the interferogram selection is based on the spatial coherence enables deformation mapping in vegetated areas and leads to reﬁned estimates of along-fault surface creep rates.

We estimate the long-term slip rates by inverting the long-wavelength deformation and the distribution of shallow slip due to creep by inverting the remaining velocity ﬁeld. This distribution of slip reveals the locations of locked and slowly creeping patches with potential for a M6.8 ± 0.3 on the HF near San Leandro, a M6.6 ± 0.2 on the northern CF near Dublin, a M6.5 ± 0.1 on the HF south of Fremont, and a M6.2 ± 0.2 on the central CF near Morgan Hill.

The Chihshang fault in eastern Taiwan is characterized by such behavior and has been known to undergo 2–3 cm/yr surface creep, making it one of the most active creeping thrust faults known in the world. It gives an excellent opportunity to study how a creeping fault can generate large earthquakes. However, the understanding of fault behavior at depth in this area has been limited due to sparse sampling from seismic and geodetic stations. In this study we determine and evaluate a population of repeating earthquakes to improve the understanding of deep fault deformation. We propose a repeating sequence identiﬁcation scheme in the region where the station coverage is sparse and one-sided. Using this identiﬁcation method, we found 30 M 2–3 characteristic repeating sequences under the northern half of the Chihshang fault at 7–23 km depth. Slip estimates from these sequences indicate an average slip rate of ∼ 3 cm/yr, which is consistent with the rate inferred from surface geodetic measurements.

Using 202 ML 2.0 to 4.6 repeating earthquake sequences (RES) during the period from 2000 to 2011, we studied where and how certain faults creep. The RES were found to be highly concentrated in the southern segment of the Longitudinal Valley fault (LVF) and in the northern segment of the Central Range fault (CRF). They are mainly located at a depth of 10–25 km and show strong regional differences in creep behavior. Using the moment release rate of RES and geodetically derived long‐term slip rate, we re‐estimate the empirical relationship between deep creep and seismic moment for creeping sections in eastern Taiwan. For the 30‐km‐long LVF, the creep rate increased dramatically from 1.5 to 12.3 cm/year under the inﬂuence of the ML 6.4 Chengkung earthquake of 2003. For the 80‐km‐long CRF, the high creep rate of 4.3 cm/year appears to have been stable over time and is descriptive of a previously unrecognized deep structure underneath the eastern ﬂank of the Central Range. The quasiperiodic pulsing of the deep slip rate has a predominant interval of 1 year for both segments. After the ML 6.4 event, the predominant interval for the creeping LVF halved in duration. The time‐dependent aseismic slip showed a strong correlation with the creepmeter data, suggesting that the positing of a common mechanism is needed to connect the surface and deep creep variation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Yaochieh"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Kate Huihsuan"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Jyr‐Ching"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Jian‐Cheng"}],"citation-key":"Chen.etal_2020_ProbingVariation","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"Chen.Lapusta_2019_BehaviourScaling","abstract":"With abundant seismic data for small repeating earthquakes, it is important to construct a dynamic model that can explain various aspects of related observations. In this work, we study small repeating earthquakes on a fault governed by rate- and state-dependent friction laws. The earthquakes occur on a velocity-weakening patch surrounded by a much larger velocity-strengthening region. The whole fault is subject to long-term tectonic loading. The model with a circular patch and the aging form of rate- and state-dependent friction laws has been shown to reproduce the scaling of recurrence time versus seismic moment for small repeating earthquakes in a previous study. Here we investigate the behaviour of small repeating earthquakes in related models under different scenarios, including several forms of the state evolution equations in rate- and state-dependent friction laws, rectangular velocity-weakening patch geometries, quasi-dynamic versus fully dynamic representation of inertial effects and 2-D versus 3-D simulations. We find that the simulated scalings between the recurrence time and seismic moment for these different scenarios is similar while differences do exist. We propose a theoretical consideration for the scaling between the recurrence time and seismic moment of small repeating earthquakes. For patch radii smaller than or comparable to the full nucleation size, the scaling is explained by the increase of seismic to aseismic slip ratio with magnitude. For patch radii larger than the full nucleation size, the scaling is explained by the model in which the recurrence time is determined by the earthquake nucleation time, which is in turn determined by the time for aseismic slip to penetrate the distance of the full nucleation size into the patch. The obtained theoretical insight is used to find the combinations of fault properties that allow the model to fit the observed scaling and range of the seismic moment and recurrence time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Ting"},{"family":"Lapusta","given":"Nadia"}],"citation-key":"Chen.Lapusta_2019_BehaviourScaling","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","container-title-short":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1093/gji/ggz270","ISSN":"0956-540X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",9,1]]},"page":"2001-2018","source":"Silverchair","title":"On behaviour and scaling of small repeating earthquakes in rate and state fault models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggz270","volume":"218"},
  {"id":"Chen.Shearer_2013_CaliforniaForeshock","abstract":"Foreshocks are one of the few well-documented precursors to large earthquakes; therefore, understanding their nature is very important for earthquake prediction and hazard mitigation. However, the triggering role of foreshocks is not yet clear. It is possible that foreshocks are a self-triggering cascade of events that simply happen to trigger an unusually large aftershock; alternatively, foreshocks might originate from an external aseismic process that ultimately triggers the mainshock. In the former case, the foreshocks will have limited utility for forecasting. The latter case has been observed for several individual large earthquakes; however, it remains unclear how common it is and how to distinguish foreshock sequences from other seismicity clusters that do not lead to large earthquakes. Here we analyze foreshocks of three M>7 mainshocks in southern California. These foreshock sequences appear similar to earthquake swarms, in that they do not start with their largest events and they exhibit spatial migration of seismicity. Analysis of source spectra shows that all three foreshock sequences feature lower average stress drops and depletion of high-frequency energy compared with the aftershocks of their corresponding mainshocks. Using a longer-term stress-drop catalog, we find that the average stress drop of the Landers and Hector Mine foreshock sequences is comparable to nearby swarms. Our observations suggest that these foreshock sequences are manifestations of aseismic transients occurring close to the mainshock hypocenters, possibly related to localized fault zone complexity, which have promoted the occurrence of both the foreshocks and the eventual mainshock.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Xiaowei"},{"family":"Shearer","given":"Peter M."}],"citation-key":"Chen.Shearer_2013_CaliforniaForeshock","container-title":"Geophysical Research Letters","DOI":"10.1002/grl.50444","ISSN":"1944-8007","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"en","page":"2602-2607","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"California foreshock sequences suggest aseismic triggering process","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/grl.50444","volume":"40"},

While challenging even in the best of circumstances, this problem poses unique difficulties when the dimensions of the interferometric input data exceed the limits of one's computational capabilities. In order to deal with such cases, we propose a technique for applying the statistical-cost, network-flow phase-unwrapping algorithm (SNAPHU) of Chen and Zebker (2001) to large datasets. Specifically, we introduce a methodology whereby a large interferogram is partitioned into a set of several smaller tiles that are unwrapped individually and then divided further into independent, irregularly shaped reliable regions. These regions are subsequently assembled into a full unwrapped solution, with the phase offsets between regions computed in a secondary optimization problem whose objective is to maximize the a posteriori probability of the final solution. As this secondary problem assumes the same statistical models as employed in the initial tile-unwrapping stage, the technique results in a solution that approximates the solution that would have been obtained had the full-size interferogram been unwrapped as a single piece. The secondary problem is framed in terms of network-flow ideas, allowing the use of an existing nonlinear solver. Applying the algorithm to a large topographic interferogram acquired over central Alaska, we find that the technique is less prone to unwrapping artifacts than more simple tiling approaches.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"C.W."},{"family":"Zebker","given":"H.A."}],"citation-key":"Chen.Zebker_2002_PhaseUnwrapping","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","DOI":"10.1109/TGRS.2002.802453","ISSN":"1558-0644","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",8]]},"page":"1709-1719","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Phase unwrapping for large SAR interferograms: statistical segmentation and generalized network models","title-short":"Phase unwrapping for large SAR interferograms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1036000","volume":"40"},

Often, these distortions are attributed to spatially variable ionospheric propagation delays at two different SAR acquisition times. We present here L-band InSAR data from Iceland, California, and Hawaii. The California and Hawaii interferograms show no signiﬁcant ionospheric artifacts, while the Iceland interferogram shows a maximum misregistration of three pixels in the azimuth direction, which leads to severe phase decorrelation artifacts in the InSAR image. We relate the misregistration of complex pixels seen in the interferograms to the gradient of the ionospheric total electron content (TEC) observed by global positioning system (GPS) data and conﬁrm that indeed the phase artifacts in the Iceland interferogram are due to dispersive ionospheric propagation rather than other decorrelation factors such as neutral atmospheric delays. We develop a method to measure the spatial TEC variation at synthetic aperture length scales using dual-frequency GPS carrier phase data. We solve for the GPS data ambiguities using a low-resolution ionosphere reference derived from either available ionospheric observations or the GPS carrier phase data themselves. GPS observations show directly the level of ionospheric variability, and the spatial TEC gradient as observed by GPS predicts the misregistration of complex pixels in interferograms in all three areas. This conﬁrmation of the cause of the image artifacts suggests that they can be routinely corrected from the InSAR data alone, provided that the sensor measures the change in TEC along the radar swath.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Jingyi"},{"family":"Zebker","given":"Howard A."}],"citation-key":"Chen.Zebker_2012_IonosphericArtifacts","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","container-title-short":"IEEE Trans.

  {"id":"Chen.Zebker_2014_ReducingIonospheric","abstract":"Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is a valuable tool for the study of geophysical phenomena such as crustal deformation, ice motion and structure, and vegetation canopy depths, but it is adversely affected by uncharacterized inhomogeneities in ionospheric propagation delay. Ionospheric disturbances distort both InSAR phase and correlation maps. Here, we present a method to compensate ionospheric propagation variations using accurate image coregistration. This signiﬁcantly improves both the interferometric coherence and phase accuracy. An azimuth gradient in the total electron content (TEC) from a spatially variable ionosphere results in a range-dependent azimuth phase gradient being added to the phase histories of the pixels being imaged. These phase gradients are equivalent to Doppler shifts, and thus they cause azimuth offsets between the actual and imaged positions of the pixels. Measuring these offsets accurately permits estimation of the gradient and correction of the interferograms for much of the phase distortion, resulting in more accurate estimates of coherence. We show an example over Greenland where the TEC variation causes the correlation to drop from about 0.7 to about 0.2 in one region if spatially varying offsets are not accounted for; it also adds an estimated 4.4 radians of interferometric phase over an 80 km InSAR scene. After applying our algorithm, we ﬁnd that the correlation in regions affected by the ionospheric inhomogeneity becomes comparable to correlation in the rest of the image. In a more challenging example over Iceland, we show that our method improves the correlation from 0.15 to 0.25 in some areas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Albert C."},{"family":"Zebker","given":"Howard A."}],"citation-key":"Chen.Zebker_2014_ReducingIonospheric","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","container-title-short":"IEEE Trans.

  {"id":"ChenChen.etal_2022_RemovingInSAR","abstract":"Atmospheric effects are among the primary error sources affecting the accuracy of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). The topography-dependent atmospheric effect is particularly noteworthy in reservoir areas for landslide monitoring utilizing InSAR, which must be effectively corrected to complete the InSAR high-accuracy measurement. This paper proposed a topography-dependent atmospheric correction method based on the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network model combined with topography and spatial data information. We used this proposed approach for the atmospheric correction of the interferometric pairs of Sentinel-1 images in the Baihetan dam. We contrasted the outcomes with those obtained using the generic atmospheric correction online service for InSAR (GACOS) correction and the traditional linear model correction. The results indicated that the MLP neural network model correction reduced the phase standard deviation of the Sentinel-1 interferogram by an average of 64% and nearly eliminated the phase-elevation correlation. Both comparisons outperformed the GACOS correction and the linear model correction. Through two real-world examples, we demonstrated how slopes with displacements, which were previously obscured by a significant topography-dependent atmospheric delay, could be successfully and clearly identified in the interferograms following the correction by the MLP neural network. The topography-dependent atmosphere can be better corrected using the MLP neural network model suggested in this paper. Unlike the previous model, this proposed approach could be adjusted to fit each interferogram, regardless of how much of the topography-dependent atmosphere was present. In order to improve the effectiveness of DInSAR and time-series InSAR solutions, it can be applied immediately to the interferogram to retrieve the effective displacement information that cannot be identified before the correction.","author":[{"literal":"Chen Chen"},{"family":"Dai","given":"Keren"},{"literal":"Xiaochuan Tang"},{"literal":"Jianhua Cheng"},{"family":"Pirasteh","given":"Saied"},{"literal":"Mingtang Wu"},{"literal":"Xianlin Shi"},{"literal":"Hao Zhou"},{"family":"Li","given":"Zhenhong"}],"citation-key":"ChenChen.etal_2022_RemovingInSAR","container-title":"Remote Sensing","DOI":"10.3390/rs14174171","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"note":"ZSCC:00000\nMAG ID: 4293207257","title":"Removing InSAR Topography-Dependent Atmospheric Effect Based on Deep Learning","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"Cheng.etal_2023_RefinedEarthquake","abstract":"Earthquake focal mechanisms, determined with P-wave polarities and S/P amplitude ratios, are primary data for analyzing fault zone geometry, sense of slip, and the crustal stress field. Solving for the focal mechanisms of small earthquakes is often challenging because phase arrivals and first-motion polarities are hard to be separated from noise. To overcome this challenge, we implement convolutional-neural-network algorithms (Ross, Meier, & Hauksson, 2018, Ross, Meier, Hauksson, & Heaton, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1029/2017jb015251, https://doi.org/10.1785/0120180080) to detect additional phases and polarities. Using both existing and these new data, we build a high-quality focal mechanism catalog of 297,478 events that occurred from 1981 to 2021 in southern California with the HASH method of Hardebeck and Shearer (2002), https://doi.org/10.1785/0120010200, Hardebeck and Shearer (2003), https://doi.org/10.1785/0120020236. The new focal mechanism catalog is overall consistent with the standard catalog (Yang et al., 2012, https://doi.org/10.1785/0120110311) but includes 40% more focal mechanisms, and is more consistent with moment tensor solutions derived using waveform-fitting methods. We apply the new catalog to identify changes in focal mechanism properties caused by the occurrences of large mainshocks such as the 2010 Mw7.2 El Mayor-Cucapah and 2019 Mw7.1 Ridgecrest earthquakes. Such changes may be associated with co-seismic stress drops, post-seismic deformation processes, and static stress changes on a regional scale. The new high-resolution catalog will contribute to improved understanding of the crustal stress field, earthquake triggering mechanisms, fault zone geometry, and sense of slip on the faults in southern California.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Cheng","given":"Yifang"},{"family":"Hauksson","given":"Egill"},{"family":"Ben-Zion","given":"Yehuda"}],"citation-key":"Cheng.etal_2023_RefinedEarthquake","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/2022JB025975","ISSN":"2169-9356","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC:00000","page":"e2022JB025975","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Refined Earthquake Focal Mechanism Catalog for Southern California Derived With Deep Learning Algorithms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2022JB025975","volume":"128"},

However, measurements made at different time scales on intracontinental faults suggest that slip rate evolves with time. We examine the slip evolution of a fault embedded in an elastic lithosphere loaded by plate motion. We first assume that the fault friction varies due to a climatic cause. Then we show that high fault stress and low lithospheric stiffness favour large variations of slip rate. In the case where fault weakening is controlled by slip rate, we find that high loading velocity leads to a low stress, constant slip rate, while low loading velocity drives the fault slip rate to cycle between high and low values. This suggests that paleoseismic slip rate could overpass the loading velocity but also fall to zero for some period of time.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Chery","given":"J"},{"family":"Vernant","given":"P"}],"citation-key":"Chery.Vernant_2006_LithosphericElasticity","container-title":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","container-title-short":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","DOI":"10.1016/j.epsl.2005.12.014","ISSN":"0012821X","issue":"1-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",3,15]]},"language":"en","page":"211-217","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Lithospheric elasticity promotes episodic fault activity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0012821X05008721","volume":"243"},

A new compilation of marine geophysical data permits delineation of the structure of the northern Red Sea and of the manner in which the transition from continental to oceanic extension is occurring in this rift. The margins of the northern Red Sea are formed by large, apparently active faults on the seaward edge of the narrow continental shelves. The morphology of the main trough is a series of terraces stepping down to an axial depression. The terraces are a subdued expression of the basement structure, which consists of a series of large rotated fault blocks. The axial depression is an often fault-bounded axis of deep water that extends south from the Suez triple junction. The rift is segmented along-strike by throughgoing accommodation zones spaced at 40–60 km intervals along the rift. In the main trough, accommodation zones truncate or offset rift-parallel bathymetric and gravity features. The axial depression consists of a series of discrete depressions offset from each other and separated by slightly shallower areas corresponding to accommodation zones. Within each segment, the axial depression deepens away from the accommodation zones toward a small deep, a few kilometers across and a few hundred meters deeper than the surrounding seafloor. A pair of small volcanoes is perched on top of the scarps bounding the axial depression on either side of the deep within each segment. The volcanoes are all normally magnetized and interpreted as very young. The crust is uniformly thin (5–8.5 km) throughout the main trough, implying extension evenly spread across the rift through much of its development. As extension recently became concentrated at the axis, melt began to be generated and is focused to a location within the segment where it ascends along faults bounding the axial depression to form the pair of volcanoes flanking the axis. A volcano is also found on the floor of the axial depression in one segment. This isolated volcano appears to be the first step in the development of the seafloor spreading cells that are observed in the central Red Sea. The individual cells then grow and coalesce to become a continuous spreading axis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Cochran","given":"James R."}],"citation-key":"Cochran_2005_NorthernRed","container-title":"Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems","DOI":"10.1029/2004GC000826","ISSN":"1525-2027","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC:00122","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Northern Red Sea: Nucleation of an oceanic spreading center within a continental rift","title-short":"Northern Red Sea","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2004GC000826","volume":"6"},

Although global plate models predict 2.3–3.6 cm/yr left-lateral motion between both plates, the fault is known to have hosted few earthquakes in historical times. Recent geodetic measurements attested the presence of aseismic slip locally. To detail the interplay between fast and slow slip along the CF, we build three Interferometric Synthetic-Aperture Radar time series of ground deformation covering the whole fault length over 5 years (2014–2019). We find that most of the active fault trace slips aseismically and continuously. From south to north, we identify three creeping fault portions: the Nushki, Central, and Qalat segments of lengths between 80 and 130 km. The loading rate is 1.2 ± 0.3 cm/yr for the two southernmost portions, while it is about 0.7 ± 0.2 cm/yr for the Qalat segment. The Central segment and the nearby locked segments have hosted the largest known historical earthquakes on the CF, and three moderate magnitude earthquakes in our observation period. We image these earthquakes for which modeled slip at depth (Mw 5–5.6), time series of surface slip and deformation patterns argue toward large triggered aseismic slip. The June 2018 event displays postseismic moment 3–15 times greater than coseismic moment. Over the two decades covered by geodetic observations, continuous or triggered aseismic slip dominates along most of the fault and co-locates with earthquakes. We observe that fault geometrical complexities delimit active segments and may be responsible for the kilometer-scale intertwining between seismic and aseismic events.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",12,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Dalaison","given":"M."},{"family":"Jolivet","given":"R."},{"family":"Rijsingen","given":"E.

KFTS solves together for the evolution of phase change with time and for a parametrized model of ground deformation. Synthetic tests of the KFTS reveal exact agreement with the equivalent weighted least squares solution and a convergence of descriptive model parameter after the assimilation of about 1 year of data. We include the impact of sudden deformation events such as earthquakes or slow slip events on the time series of displacement. First tests of the KFTS on ENVISAT data over Mt.

Otherwise, the optimized parametrized model is used to forecast phase change. Good agreement is found with classic time series analysis solution and GPS-derived time series.

The resulting sequences of SSEs match observations from the Cascadia subduction zone, including the earthquake-like cubic moment-duration scaling.

  {"id":"Dascher-Cousineau.etal_2018_SmoothingFault","abstract":"Previous field observations suggest that fault slip surface roughness may decrease with slip. However, measurements have yet to confidently isolate the effect of slip from other possible controls, such as lithology or tectonic setting. We describe the evolution of slip surfaces in normal faults in SE Utah that cut well-sorted, high-porosity sandstones and accommodated regional extension at 1- to 4-km depth. Tight controls on fault offset and uniform tectonic history allowed us to isolate the effect of slip during early stages of faulting (0- to 55-m slip). Slip surfaces progress from rough joints and deformation bands toward smooth, continuous, and mirror-like surfaces with increasing slip. We collected 123 scans of pristine slip surfaces, which measure surface geometry from micrometers to meters in length scale. Results indicate that slip surface roughness is systematically smoother than joint surfaces and deformation band edges. Over the best resolved length scales (0.1–10 mm), we observe roughness decreases with slip according to a power law with exponent −1 in the slip direction. Slip-perpendicular profiles, though rougher, exhibit the same smoothing trend. The Hurst scaling exponent does not change with slip. These observations require wear to be multiscale. Boundary element method models suggest that mechanical wear of completely mated surfaces occurs by asperity failure and that the wear rate depends on the aspect ratio of asperities. These results indicate that at large slip, asperity failure at all length scales can cause slip surfaces to smooth while maintaining the fractal geometry characteristic of faults.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Dascher-Cousineau","given":"Kelian"},{"family":"Kirkpatrick","given":"James D."},{"family":"Cooke","given":"Michele L."}],"citation-key":"Dascher-Cousineau.etal_2018_SmoothingFault","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/2018JB015638","ISSN":"2169-9356","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","license":"©2018.

  {"id":"Dascher-Cousineau.etal_2020_TwoForeshock","abstract":"Recognizing earthquakes as foreshocks in real time would provide a valuable forecasting capability. In a recent study, Gulia and Wiemer (2019) proposed a traffic‐light system that relies on abrupt changes in b‐values relative to background values. The approach utilizes high‐resolution earthquake catalogs to monitor localized regions around the largest events and distinguish foreshock sequences (reduced b‐values) from aftershock sequences (increased b‐values). The recent well‐recorded earthquake foreshock sequences in Ridgecrest, California, and Maria Antonia, Puerto Rico, provide an opportunity to test the procedure. For Ridgecrest, our b‐value time series indicates an elevated risk of a larger impending earthquake during the Mw 6.4 foreshock sequence and provides an ambiguous identification of the onset of the Mw 7.1 aftershock sequence. However, the exact result depends strongly on expert judgment. Monte Carlo sampling across a range of reasonable decisions most often results in ambiguous warning levels. In the case of the Puerto Rico sequence, we record significant drops in b‐value prior to and following the largest event (Mw 6.4) in the sequence. The b‐value has still not returned to background levels (12 February 2020). The Ridgecrest sequence roughly conforms to expectations; the Puerto Rico sequence will only do so if a larger event occurs in the future with an ensuing b‐value increase. Any real‐time implementation of this approach will require dense instrumentation, consistent (versioned) low completeness catalogs, well‐calibrated maps of regionalized background b‐values, systematic real‐time catalog production, and robust decision making about the event source volumes to analyze.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Dascher‐Cousineau","given":"Kelian"},{"family":"Lay","given":"Thorne"},{"family":"Brodsky","given":"Emily E."}],"citation-key":"Dascher-Cousineau.etal_2020_TwoForeshock","container-title":"Seismological Research Letters","container-title-short":"Seismological Research Letters","DOI":"10.1785/0220200082","ISSN":"0895-0695","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,8]]},"page":"2843-2850","source":"Silverchair","title":"Two Foreshock Sequences Post Gulia and Wiemer (2019)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1785/0220200082","volume":"91"},
  {"id":"Dascher-Cousineau.etal_2020_WhatControls","abstract":"The number of aftershocks increases with mainshock size following a well-defined scaling law. However, excursions from the average behavior are common. This variability is particularly concerning for large earthquakes where the number of aftershocks varies by factors of 100 for mainshocks of comparable magnitude. Do observable factors lead to differences in aftershock behavior? We examine aftershock productivity relative to the global average for all mainshocks ( ) from 1990 to 2019. A global map of earthquake productivity highlights the influence of tectonic regimes. Earthquake depth, lithosphere age, and plate boundary type correspond well with earthquake productivity. We investigate the role of mainshock attributes by compiling source dimensions, radiated seismic energy, stress drop, and a measure of slip heterogeneity based on finite-fault source inversions for the largest earthquakes from 1990 to 2017. On an individual basis, stress drop, normalized rupture width, and aspect ratio most strongly correlate with aftershock productivity. A multivariate analysis shows that a particular set of parameters (dip, lithospheric age, and normalized rupture area) combines well to improve predictions of aftershock productivity on a cross-validated data set. Our overall analysis is consistent with a model in which the volumetric abundance of nearby stressed faults controls the aftershock productivity rather than variations in source stress. Thus, we suggest a complementary approach to aftershock forecasts based on geological and rupture properties rather than local calibration alone.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Dascher-Cousineau","given":"Kelian"},{"family":"Brodsky","given":"Emily E."},{"family":"Lay","given":"Thorne"},{"family":"Goebel","given":"Thomas H.

Offset channels in the Carrizo Plain, California, capture the fluvial response to lateral slip on the San Andreas Fault on millennial time scales. We developed and tested a model that quantifies competition between fault slip, which elongates channels, and aggradation, which causes channel infilling and, ultimately, abandonment. Validation of this model supports a transport-limited fluvial response and implies that measurements derived from present-day channel geometry are sufficient to quantify the rate of bedload transport relative to slip rate. Extension of the model identifies the threshold for which persistent change in transport capacity, obliquity in slip, or advected topography results in reorganization of the drainage network.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Dascher-Cousineau","given":"Kelian"},{"family":"Finnegan","given":"Noah J."},{"family":"Brodsky","given":"Emily E."}],"citation-key":"Dascher-Cousineau.etal_2021_LifeSpan","container-title":"Science","DOI":"10.1126/science.abf2320","issue":"6551","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,9]]},"page":"204-207","publisher":"American Association for the Advancement of Science","source":"science.org (Atypon)","title":"The life span of fault-crossing channels","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.abf2320","volume":"373"},

The model enables access to a greater volume and diversity of earthquake observations, overcoming the theoretical and computational limitations of traditional approaches. We benchmark against a temporal Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence model. Tests on synthetic data suggest that with a modest-sized data set, RECAST accurately models earthquake-like point processes directly from cataloged data. Tests on earthquake catalogs in Southern California indicate improved fit and forecast accuracy compared to our benchmark when the training set is sufficiently long (>104 events).

  {"id":"Davis_1986_SurfaceDeformation","abstract":"Approximate expressions for surface displacements due to fluid inflation of an arbitrarily oriented ellipsoidal cavity in an elastic half?space are found using Eshelby's elastic inclusion theory and Mindlin's half?space point force solution. The cavity is replaced by material having the same properties as the surrounding medium. The point force distribution on its surface is determined which exerts a uniform pressure on the medium immediately outside its boundary. Then the ellipsoid and its forces may be removed and replaced by material strained to generate the same pressure without affecting the solution in the remainder of the medium. The half?space point force solutions were found which satisfy boundary conditions exactly on the free surface but approximately on the ellipsoid. The approximation becomes exact for a deeply buried ellipsoid and is reasonably accurate if the depth to its center is greater than twice its dimension. The far?field solution is a weighted combination of displacements from nine double forces located at the ellipsoid center. The model was applied to measured displacement on Kilauea volcano taken over a period of intrusion and eruption, with the result that a vertically elongated ellipsoidal pressure center fits the data significantly better than a spherical one. However, earthquake swarm activity spread over the zone during the inflation episode, which demonstrates that the medium does not respond elastically. The volume of the slip found by summing seismic moments is of the same order as the surface uplift, suggesting that anelastic accommodation of the intruded material by the surrounding medium is significant. The pressure center is therefore a combination of magma pressure and failed matrix. Its vertical elongation confirms the contention that vertical elongation is expected when the volcano undergoes extreme stressing beyond the elastic limit.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Davis","given":"Paul M."}],"citation-key":"Davis_1986_SurfaceDeformation","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","container-title-short":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/JB091iB07p07429","ISSN":"0148-0227","issue":"B7","issued":{"date-parts":[["1986"]]},"page":"7429-7438","source":"agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","title":"Surface deformation due to inflation of an arbitrarily oriented triaxial ellipsoidal cavity in an elastic half‐space, with reference to Kilauea volcano, Hawaii","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JB091iB07p07429","volume":"91"},

We ﬁnd episodes of ground deformation at each volcano, which we invert using analytic elastic half-space models to make some of the ﬁrst geophysical inferences about the source depths of potential magma chambers. At Llaima, we interpret that the VEI 2 April 3, 2009 eruption was preceded by ~6–15 cm of precursory ground uplift one month before from a source ~5 km below the surface on the western side of the ediﬁce. The VEI 2 March 3, 2015 Villarrica eruption was followed by a short lived uplift of 5 cm in the SE part of the volcano from a source depth of ~6 km. The VEI 4 April 22–23, 2015 Calbuco eruption produced 12 cm of coeruptive subsidence from a source depth 8–11 km and offset ~2 km S from the summit. Importantly, we do not ﬁnd clear evidence that the January 1, 2008, the March 3, 2015 and April 22, 2015 eruptions at Llaima, Villarrica and Calbuco volcanoes were preceded by either transient or continuous ground uplift. There are several possible explanations for the lack of precursory deformation at each volcano – it is possible that any precursory deformation occurred only hours before the eruption (e.g., at Calbuco), pre-eruptive inﬂation was canceled by co-eruptive subsidence (as we inferred happened during the April 2009 Llaima eruption), the pre-eruptive deformation was too small to be detectable in areas with persistent topography correlated phase delays, pressurized source are deep, or that open-vent volcanoes like Villarrica and Llaima do not pressurize. At all three volcanoes, X and C band interferograms decorrelate in a few weeks due to vegetation, snow and ice, and have persistent atmospheric phase delays that we ﬁnd cannot be reliably removed with available global weather models. The low number of SAR acquisitions therefore makes it challenging to reliably measure unaliased deformation. We recommend a multi-satellite observing strategy with short repeat periods, frequently acquired high-resolution digital elevation models, and with acquisitions during every satellite overﬂight that may improve the temporal resolution of measurements.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Delgado","given":"Francisco"},{"family":"Pritchard","given":"Matthew E."},{"family":"Ebmeier","given":"Susanna"},{"family":"González","given":"Pablo"},{"family":"Lara","given":"Luis"}],"citation-key":"Delgado.etal_2017_RecentUnrest","container-title":"Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research","container-title-short":"Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research","DOI":"10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2017.05.020","ISSN":"03770273","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9]]},"language":"en","page":"270-288","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Recent unrest (2002–2015) imaged by space geodesy at the highest risk Chilean volcanoes: Villarrica, Llaima, and Calbuco (Southern Andes)","title-short":"Recent unrest (2002–2015) imaged by space geodesy at the highest risk Chilean volcanoes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0377027317303086","volume":"344"},

A major component of these investigations was a combined reflection/refraction survey across the territories of Palestine, Israel and Jordan. The main results of this study are: (1) The seismic basement is offset by 3–5 km under the DST, (2) The DST cuts through the entire crust, broadening in the lower crust, (3) Strong lower crustal reflectors are imaged only on one side of the DST, (4) The seismic velocity sections show a steady increase in the depth of the crust-mantle transition (Moho) from ∼26 km at the Mediterranean to ∼39 km under the Jordan highlands, with only a small but visible, asymmetric topography of the Moho under the DST. These observations can be linked to the left-lateral movement of 105 km of the two plates in the last 17 Myr, accompanied by strong deformation within a narrow zone cutting through the entire crust. Comparing the DST and the San Andreas Fault (SAF) system, a strong asymmetry in subhorizontal lower crustal reflectors and a deep reaching deformation zone both occur around the DST and the SAF. The fact that such lower crustal reflectors and deep deformation zones are observed in such different transform systems suggests that these structures are possibly fundamental features of large transform plate boundaries.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,21]]},"author":[{"literal":"DESERT Group"},{"family":"Weber","given":"M."},{"family":"Abu-Ayyash","given":"K."},{"family":"Abueladas","given":"A."},{"family":"Agnon","given":"A."},{"family":"Al-Amoush","given":"H."},{"family":"Babeyko","given":"A."},{"family":"Bartov","given":"Y."},{"family":"Baumann","given":"M."},{"family":"Ben-Avraham","given":"Z."},{"family":"Bock","given":"G."},{"family":"Bribach","given":"J."},{"family":"El-Kelani","given":"R."},{"family":"Förster","given":"A."},{"family":"Förster","given":"H.-J."},{"family":"Frieslander","given":"U."},{"family":"Garfunkel","given":"Z."},{"family":"Grunewald","given":"S."},{"family":"Götze","given":"H.

  {"id":"Diao.etal_2021_OverlappedPostseismic","abstract":"Studying transient postseismic deformation is one of the key approaches to probe fault kinematics and rheological behavior of rocks surrounding tectonic faults. Previous studies have shown that transient postseismic deformation is dominantly induced by afterslip and postseismic viscoelastic relaxation. However, effects of these two mechanisms are generally overlapped in space and time, making the analysis of the observations challenging. Here, we investigate the overlapping effects of afterslip and viscoelastic relaxation following the 2015 Gorkha earthquake based on the first 4-years’ Global Positioning System observations and finite element models. Separated mechanisms either fail to explain the observations or lead to unreasonable model parameters. A combined model that incorporates stressdriven afterslip and viscoelastic relaxation can overcome the limitations of separated mechanisms. Our results indicate that only short-term (<1 year) postseismic deformation in near-to middle-fields is caused mainly by afterslip, whereas that in far-field or long-term are dominated by the viscoelastic relaxation effect. The stress-driven afterslip is mainly confined to a narrow zone adjacent to the coseismic rupture asperities, in contrast to the widespread deep afterslip as suggested by previous studies. The total seismic moment released by the afterslip is ∼5% of that released by the Mw 7.8 main shock. The optimal viscosity of the lower crust beneath the south Tibet is estimated to be 2.5 × 1018 Pa∙s, which is at least one order lower than that beneath Indian plate, suggesting a significant lateral variation across the Himalayan fault. Validations by using independent InSAR observations further confirm the reliability of the combined model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Diao","given":"Faqi"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Rongjiang"},{"family":"Xiong","given":"Xiong"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Chengli"}],"citation-key":"Diao.etal_2021_OverlappedPostseismic","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","container-title-short":"J Geophys Res Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/2020JB020378","ISSN":"2169-9313, 2169-9356","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Overlapped Postseismic Deformation Caused by Afterslip and Viscoelastic Relaxation Following the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha (Nepal) Earthquake","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2020JB020378","volume":"126"},
  {"id":"DiCaprio_2010_MeasuringModeling","abstract":"Viscoelastic relaxation of the stress perturbation caused by an earthquake or diking event can produce measurable ground deformation over 100 km away from the source. We consider the role of viscoelastic relaxation in two diﬀerent contexts. First, we explore the role that post-seismic relaxation may play in loading a fault over the entire seismic cycle. Viscous relaxation recycles the stress that is shed by the co-seismic fault, acting to reload the fault with stresses in a non-linear fashion. Under conditions of rapid post-seismic relaxation and slow tectonic loading, stress recycling via viscoelastic relaxation can lead to clustering of earthquakes in time. The second context in which we consider viscoelastic relaxation involves the lithospheric response to a mid-ocean ridge rifting episode in Northern Iceland. The diking and subsequent relaxation act as a natural rock mechanics experiment, and in measuring and modeling the post-rifting response we aim to constrain the rheological properties of the Icelandic lithosphere. In order to use post-seismic or post-rifting relaxation to probe properties of the lithosphere, we must be able to precisely measure surface deformation. To that end, we have developed a couple of new interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) processing approaches: (1) Automatically producing multiple interferograms in a common coordinate system and (2) removing displacements caused by ocean tidal loading from InSAR observations. Both of these developments are essential as we begin to consider the systematic use of tens to hundreds of interferograms.","author":[{"family":"DiCaprio","given":"Christopher J"}],"citation-key":"DiCaprio_2010_MeasuringModeling","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC:00004","source":"Zotero","title":"Measuring and Modeling Viscoelastic Relaxation of the Lithosphere with Application to the Northern Volcanic Zone, Iceland","type":"thesis"},
  {"id":"DiCaprio.etal_2008_PostseismicReloading","abstract":"Geological studies show evidence for temporal clustering of large earthquakes on individual fault systems. Since post-seismic deformation due to the inelastic rheology of the lithosphere may result in a variable loading rate on a fault throughout the interseismic period, it is reasonable to expect that the rheology of the non-seismogenic lower crust and mantle lithosphere may play a role in controlling earthquake recurrence times. We study this phenomenon using a 2-D, finite element method continuum model of the lithosphere containing a single strike-slip fault. This model builds on a previous study using a 1-D spring-dashpot-slider analogue of a single fault system to study the role of Maxwell viscoelastic relaxation in producing non-periodic earthquakes. In our 2-D model, the seismogenic portion of the fault slips when a predetermined yield stress is exceeded; stress accumulated on the seismogenic fault is shed to the viscoelastic layers below and recycled back to the seismogenic fault through viscoelastic relaxation. We find that random variation of the fault yield stress from one earthquake to the next can cause the earthquake sequence to be clustered; the amount of clustering depends on a non-dimensional number, W, called the Wallace number defined as the standard deviation of the randomly varied fault yield stress divided by the effective viscosity of the system times the tectonic loading rate. A new clustering metric based on the bimodal distribution of interseismic intervals allows us to investigate clustering behaviour of systems over a wide range of model parameters and those with multiple viscoelastic layers. For models with W ≥ 1 clustering increases with increasing W, while those with W ≤ 1 are unclustered, or quasi-periodic.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,16]]},"author":[{"family":"DiCaprio","given":"Christopher J."},{"family":"Simons","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Kenner","given":"Shelley J."},{"family":"Williams","given":"Charles A."}],"citation-key":"DiCaprio.etal_2008_PostseismicReloading","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","container-title-short":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2007.03622.x","ISSN":"0956-540X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",2,1]]},"page":"581-592","source":"Silverchair","title":"Post-seismic reloading and temporal clustering on a single fault","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2007.03622.x","volume":"172"},

Then we compare available reference frames of plate motions relative to the mantle and discuss which is at best able to fit global tectonic data. Different assumptions about the depths of hotspot sources (below or within the asthenosphere, which decouples the lithosphere from the deep mantle) predict different rates of net rotation of the lithosphere relative to the mantle. The widely used no-net-rotation (NNR) reference frame, and low (<0.2°–0.4°/Ma) net rotation rates (deep hotspots source) predict an average net rotation in which some plates move eastward relative to the mantle (e.g., Nazca). With fast (>1°/Ma) net rotation (shallow hotspots source), all plates, albeit at different velocity, move westerly along a curved trajectory, with a tectonic equator tilted about 30° relative to the geographic equator.

  {"id":"Doin.etal_2009_CorrectionsStratified","abstract":"The main limiting factor on the accuracy of Interferometric SAR measurements (InSAR) comes from phase propagation delays through the troposphere. The delay can be divided into a stratiﬁed component, which correlates with the topography and often dominates the tropospheric signal, and a turbulent component. We use Global Atmospheric Models (GAM) to estimate the stratiﬁed phase delay and delay-elevation ratio at epochs of SAR acquisitions, and compare them to observed phase delay derived from SAR interferograms. Three test areas are selected with different geographic and climatic environments and with large SAR archive available. The Lake Mead, Nevada, USA is covered by 79 ERS1/2 and ENVISAT acquisitions, the Haiyuan Fault area, Gansu, China, by 24 ERS1/2 acquisitions, and the Afar region, Republic of Djibouti, by 91 Radarsat acquisitions. The hydrostatic and wet stratiﬁed delays are computed from GAM as a function of atmospheric pressure P, temperature T, and water vapor partial pressure e vertical proﬁles. The hydrostatic delay, which depends on ratio P/T, varies signiﬁcantly at low elevation and cannot be neglected. The wet component of the delay depends mostly on the near surface speciﬁc humidity. GAM predicted delay-elevation ratios are in good agreement with the ratios derived from InSAR data away from deforming zones. Both estimations of the delay-elevation ratio can thus be used to perform a ﬁrst order correction of the observed interferometric phase to retrieve a ground motion signal of low amplitude. We also demonstrate that aliasing of daily and seasonal variations in the stratiﬁed delay due to uneven sampling of SAR data signiﬁcantly bias InSAR data stacks or time series produced after temporal smoothing. In all three test cases, the InSAR data stacks or smoothed time series present a residual stratiﬁed delay of the order of the expected deformation signal. In all cases, correcting interferograms from the stratiﬁed delay removes all these biases. We quantify the standard error associated with the correction of the stratiﬁed atmospheric delay. It varies from one site to another depending on the prevailing atmospheric conditions, but remains bounded by the standard deviation of the daily ﬂuctuations of the stratiﬁed delay around the seasonal average. Finally we suggest that the phase delay correction can potentially be improved by introducing a non-linear dependence to the elevation derived from GAM.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Doin","given":"M.-P."},{"family":"Lasserre","given":"C."},{"family":"Peltzer","given":"G."},{"family":"Cavalié","given":"O."},{"family":"Doubre","given":"C."}],"citation-key":"Doin.etal_2009_CorrectionsStratified","container-title":"Journal of Applied Geophysics","container-title-short":"Journal of Applied Geophysics","DOI":"10.1016/j.jappgeo.2009.03.010","ISSN":"09269851","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",9]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC:00341","page":"35-50","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Corrections of stratified tropospheric delays in SAR interferometry: Validation with global atmospheric models","title-short":"Corrections of stratified tropospheric delays in SAR interferometry","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0926985109000603","volume":"69"},

As the magma analogue is injected vertically into a sand cone, asymmetric deformation is caused by the formation of a curved major shear fault, which dips inward from one side of the cone to the opposite edge of the intrusion. The path of the ascending silicone deviates to follow the trajectory of the fault, and a lateral bulge grows slowly from the footwall of the fault. The oblique push makes the bulge migrate outward, causing extension upslope to form an asymmetric graben in the hanging wall of the major shear fault.

The goal of the Mars Structure Service (MSS) is to provide, as a mission product, the ﬁrst average 1‐D velocity model of Mars from the recorded InSight data. Prior to the mission, methodologies have been developed and tested to allow the location of the seismic events and estimation of the radial structure, using surface waves and body waves arrival times, and receiver functions. The paper describes these validation tests and compares the performance of the different algorithms to constrain the velocity model below the InSight station and estimate the 1‐D average model over the great circle path between source and receiver. These tests were performed in the frame of a blind test, during which synthetic data were inverted. In order to propagate the data uncertainties on the output model distribution, Bayesian inversion techniques are mainly used. The limitations and strengths of the methods are assessed. The results show the potential of the MSS approach to retrieve the structure of the crust and underlying mantle. However, at this time, large quakes with clear surface waves have not yet been recorded by SEIS, which makes the estimation of the 1‐D average seismic velocity model challenging. Additional locatable events, especially at large epicentral distances, and development of new techniques to fully investigate the data, will ultimately provide more constraints on the crust and mantle of Mars.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Drilleau","given":"Mélanie"},{"family":"Beucler","given":"Éric"},{"family":"Lognonné","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Panning","given":"Mark P."},{"family":"Knapmeyer‐Endrun","given":"Brigitte"},{"family":"Banerdt","given":"W.

Models consisting of a single asperity embedded in a creeping fault capture this scaling but fail to explain the variability in recurrence time observed during natural sequences. Here I show by a statistical analysis of repeating earthquakes generated in a rate-and-state fault model, that the observed scaling and variability in Tr are reproduced if a population of asperities is considered. For that, the density of asperities needs to be smaller than a critical threshold allowing system-size ruptures. Creep mediated stress transfers control the variability in Tr in this regime, which increases with asperity density. Beyond that density, the seismicity is highly clustered leading to moment-independent recurrence. The dynamics of repeating earthquakes could therefore be an indicator of the amount of seismogenic asperities on creeping faults.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Dublanchet","given":"P."}],"citation-key":"Dublanchet_2019_ScalingVariability","container-title":"Geophysical Research Letters","DOI":"10.1029/2019GL084614","ISSN":"1944-8007","issue":"21","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","page":"11950-11958","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Scaling and Variability of Interacting Repeating Earthquake Sequences Controlled by Asperity Density","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019GL084614","volume":"46"},
  {"id":"Duputel.etal_2014_AccountingPrediction","abstract":"This study lays the groundwork for a new generation of earthquake source models based on a general formalism that rigorously quantiﬁes and incorporates the impact of uncertainties in fault slip inverse problems. We distinguish two sources of uncertainty when considering the discrepancy between data and forward model predictions. The ﬁrst class of error is induced by imperfect measurements and is often referred to as observational error. The second source of uncertainty is generally neglected and corresponds to the prediction error, that is the uncertainty due to imperfect forward modelling. Yet the prediction error can be shown to scale approximately with the size of earthquakes and thus can dwarf the observational error, particularly for large events. Both sources of uncertainty can be formulated using the misﬁt covariance matrix, Cχ , which combines a covariance matrix for observation errors, Cd and a covariance matrix for prediction errors, Cp, associated with inaccurate model predictions. We develop a physically based stochastic forward model to treat the model prediction uncertainty and show how Cp can be constructed to explicitly account for some of the inaccuracies in the earth model. Based on a ﬁrst-order perturbation approach, our formalism relates Cp to uncertainties on the elastic parameters of different regions (e.g. crust, mantle, etc.). We demonstrate the importance of including Cp using a simple example of an inﬁnite strike-slip fault in the quasi-static approximation. In this toy model, we treat only uncertainties in the 1-D depth distribution of the shear modulus. We discuss how this can be extended to general 3-D cases and applied to other parameters (e.g. fault geometry) using our formalism for Cp. The improved modelling of Cp is expected to lead to more reliable images of the earthquake rupture, that are more resistant to overﬁtting of data and include more realistic estimates of uncertainty on inferred model parameters.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Duputel","given":"Zacharie"},{"family":"Agram","given":"Piyush S."},{"family":"Simons","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Minson","given":"Sarah E."},{"family":"Beck","given":"James L."}],"citation-key":"Duputel.etal_2014_AccountingPrediction","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1093/gji/ggt517","ISSN":"1365-246X, 0956-540X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"464-482","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Accounting for prediction uncertainty when inferring subsurface fault slip","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://academic.oup.com/gji/article/197/1/464/686313/Accounting-for-prediction-uncertainty-when","volume":"197"},

  {"id":"Dzurisin_2003_ComprehensiveApproach","abstract":"Since the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, volcanologists have made considerable progress toward predicting eruptions on the basis of precursors that typically start a few days to several months in advance. Although accurate eruption prediction is by no means routine, it may now be possible in some cases to extend the effective warning period by anticipating the onset of short?term precursors. Three promising indicators of deep magmatic processes are (1) deep, long?period earthquakes and tremor that indicate the ascent of magma through the crust, (2) magmatic CO2 emission rate as a proxy for magma supply rate, and (3) relatively broad, generally aseismic surface uplift caused by magmatic intrusions. In the latter case it is essential to sample the deformation field thoroughly in both time and space to adequately constrain source models. Until recently, this has been nearly impossible because high?precision sensors could not be deployed in sufficient numbers, nor could extensive geodetic surveys be conducted often enough. Advances in instrumentation, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), and telecommunications are helping to overcome these limitations. As a result, comprehensive geodetic monitoring of selected volcanoes is now feasible. A combination of InSAR, large?aperture GPS surveys, microgravity surveys, and dense arrays of continuous GPS stations, strain meters, and tiltmeters can reveal both spatial and temporal patterns of ground deformation throughout the eruption cycle. Improved geodetic monitoring of many of the world's volcanoes would be a major stride toward better understanding of magmatic processes and longer?term eruption forecasts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Dzurisin","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"Dzurisin_2003_ComprehensiveApproach","container-title":"Reviews of Geophysics","container-title-short":"Reviews of Geophysics","DOI":"10.1029/2001RG000107","ISSN":"8755-1209","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",2,26]]},"source":"agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","title":"A comprehensive approach to monitoring volcano deformation as a window on the eruption cycle","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2001RG000107","volume":"41"},

  {"id":"Ebmeier.etal_2018_SynthesisGlobal","abstract":"Global Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) measurements made over the past decades provide insights into the lateral extent of magmatic domains, and capture volcanic process on scales useful for volcano monitoring. Satellite-based SAR imagery has great potential for monitoring topographic change, the distribution of eruptive products and surface displacements (InSAR) at subaerial volcanoes. However, there are challenges in applying it routinely, as would be required for the reliable operational assessment of hazard. The deformation detectable depends upon satellite repeat time and swath widths, relative to the spatial and temporal scales of volcanological processes. We describe the characteristics of InSAR-measured volcano deformation over the past two decades, highlighting both the technique’s capabilities and its limitations as a monitoring tool. To achieve this, we draw on two global datasets of volcano deformation: the Smithsonian Institution Volcanoes of the World database and the Centre for the Observation and Modelling of Earthquakes, Volcanoes and Tectonics volcano deformation catalogue, as well as compiling some measurement characteristics and interpretations from the primary literature. We find that a higher proportion of InSAR observations capture non-eruptive and non-magmatic processes than those from ground-based instrument networks, and that both transient (< month) and long-duration (> 5 years) deformation episodes are under-represented. However, satellite radar is already used to assess the development of extended periods of unrest and long-lasting eruptions, and improved spatial resolution and coverage have resulted in the detection of previously unrecognised deformation at both ends of the spatial scale (~ 10 to > 1000 km2). ‘Baseline’ records of past InSAR measurements, including ‘null’ results, are fundamental for any future interpretation of interferograms in terms of hazard‚ both by providing information about past deformation at an individual volcano, and for assessing the characteristics of deformation that are likely to be detectable (and undetectable) using InSAR. More than half of all InSAR deformation signals attributed to magmatic processes have sources in the shallow crust (< 5 km depth). While the depth distribution of InSAR-derived deformation sources is affected by measurement limitations, their lateral distribution provides information about the extent of active magmatic domains. Deformation is common (24% of all potentially magmatic events) at loci ≥5 km away from the nearest active volcanic vent. This demonstrates that laterally extensive active magmatic domains are not exceptional, but can comprise the shallowest part of trans-crustal magmatic systems in a range of volcanic settings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Ebmeier","given":"S.

  {"id":"Elhadidy.etal_2021_UptodatePSHA","abstract":"The Gulf of Aqaba Dead Sea Transform fault (DSTF) is a plate boundary. Its southern section separates Sinai Peninsula, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Also, it passes through several countries. A development plan with a huge budget is drawn to develop the Gulf of Aqaba region. This plan includes the construction of King Salman Bridge. Therefore, the assessment of the seismic hazard (SH) at this seismically active region is inevitable for the sustainability of these mega projects. This paper presents a probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (PSHA) study along the DSTF. An earthquake catalogue including the paleo-seismological studies, historical records and instrumental seismicity is compiled. It is processed by converting various magnitude types to the moment magnitude (Mw) using recently derived mathematical equations. Three de-clustering techniques have been used to de-cluster the catalogue. Then, a completeness test is performed. The obtained earthquake catalogue is implemented to plot two different smoothed seismicity maps (SSMs). These maps and two areal source models are utilized to represent the seismicity along the DSTF. Five ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) are used to predict the ground-motion, three out of them are for the seismic sources located at shallow active crust tectonic regime and two for the intermediate depth earthquakes generating at the subduction zone south of Cyprus.

We present a suite of dynamic models to explain the key features from new high-resolution Sentinel-1 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) as well as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) velocities. Comparisons between calculated and geodetically observed velocity and strain rate fields indicate: (a) internal buoyancy forces from Gravitational Potential Energy (GPE) acting on a relatively weak region of highest topography (>2,000 m) contribute to dilatation of the high plateau and contraction on the margins; (b) a weak central Tibetan Plateau ~10^21 Pa s compared to far-field depth-averaged effective viscosity of 10^22 to 10^23 Pa s) is required to explain the observed long-wavelength eastward velocity variation away from major faults; (c) resisted slip on faults produces strain localization and clockwise rotation around the Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis (EHS).

  {"id":"Fasola.etal_2019_EarthquakeSwarms","abstract":"The Mexican subduction zone is an ideal location for studying subduction processes due to the short trench-to-coast distances that bring broad portions of the seismogenic and transition zones of the plate interface inland. Using a recently generated seismicity catalog from a local network in Oaxaca, we identified 20 swarms of earthquakes (M < 5) from 2006 to 2012. Swarms outline what appears to be a steeply dipping structure in the overriding plate, indicative of an origin other than the plate interface. This steeply dipping structure corresponds to the northern boundary of the Xolapa terrane. In addition, we observed an interesting characteristic of slow slip events (SSEs) where they showed a shift from trenchward motion toward an along-strike direction at coastal GPS sites. A majority of the swarms were found to correspond in time to the along-strike shift. We propose that swarms and SSEs are occurring on a sliver fault that allows the oblique convergence to be partitioned into trench-perpendicular motion on the subduction interface and trench-parallel motion on the sliver fault. The resistivity structure surrounding the sliver fault suggests that SSEs and swarms of earthquakes occur due to high fluid content in the fault zone. We propose that the sliver fault provides a natural pathway for buoyant fluids attempting to migrate upward after being released from the downgoing plate. Thus, sliver faults could be responsible for the downdip end of the seismogenic zone by creating drier conditions on the subduction interface trenchward of the sliver fault, promoting fast-slip seismogenic rupture behavior.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Fasola","given":"Shannon L."},{"family":"Brudzinski","given":"Michael R."},{"family":"Holtkamp","given":"Stephen G."},{"family":"Graham","given":"Shannon E."},{"family":"Cabral-Cano","given":"Enrique"}],"citation-key":"Fasola.etal_2019_EarthquakeSwarms","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc Natl Acad Sci USA","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1814205116","ISSN":"0027-8424, 1091-6490","issue":"15","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,9]]},"language":"en","page":"7198-7206","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Earthquake swarms and slow slip on a sliver fault in the Mexican subduction zone","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1814205116","volume":"116"},

We show that the effect of the DEM error in the estimated displacement is proportional to the perpendicular baseline history of the set of SAR acquisitions. This effect at a given epoch is proportional to the perpendicular baseline between the SAR acquisition at that epoch and the reference acquisition. Therefore, the DEM error can significantly affect the time-series results even if SB interferograms are used. We propose a new method for DEM error correction of InSAR time series, which operates in the time domain after inversion of the network of interferograms for the displacement time series. This is in contrast to the method of Berardino (2002) in which the DEM error is estimated in the interferogram domain. We show the effectiveness of this method using simulated InSAR data. We apply the new method to Fernandina volcano in the Galapagos Islands and show that the proposed DEM error correction improves the estimated displacement significantly.","author":[{"family":"Fattahi","given":"Heresh"},{"family":"Amelung","given":"Falk"}],"citation-key":"Fattahi.Amelung_2013_ErrorCorrection","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","DOI":"10.1109/TGRS.2012.2227761","ISSN":"1558-0644","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",7]]},"note":"ZSCC:00131","page":"4249-4259","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"DEM Error Correction in InSAR Time Series","type":"article-journal","volume":"51"},

The biases due to the systematic seasonal delay depend on the SAR acquisition times, whereas the uncertainties depend on the standard deviation of the random delay, the number of acquisitions, the total time span covered, and the covariance of the time series of the stochastic delay between a pixel and the reference. We study the contribution of the wet delay to the InSAR observations along the western India plate boundary using (i) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer precipitable water vapor, (ii) stratified tropospheric delay estimated from the ERA-I global atmospheric model, and (iii) seven Envisat InSAR swaths. Our analysis indicates that the amplitudes of the annual delay vary by up to 10 cm in this region equivalent to a maximum displacement bias of 24 cm in InSAR line of sight direction between two epochs (assuming Envisat IS6 beam mode). The stratified tropospheric delay correction mitigates this bias and reduces the scatter due to the stochastic delay. For 7 years of Envisat acquisitions along the western India plate boundary, the uncertainty of the InSAR velocity field due to the residual stochastic wet delay after stratified tropospheric delay correction using the ERA-I model is in the order of 2 mm/yr over 100 km and 4 mm/yr over 400 km.

  {"id":"Fattahi.etal_2016_NetworkBasedEnhanced","abstract":"For multitemporal analysis of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired with a terrain observation by progressive scan (TOPS) mode, all acquisitions from a given satellite track must be coregistered to a reference coordinate system with accuracies better than 0.001 of a pixel (assuming full SAR resolution) in the azimuth direction. Such a high accuracy can be achieved through geometric coregistration, using precise satellite orbits and a digital elevation model, followed by a refinement step using a time-series analysis of coregistration errors. These errors represent the misregistration between all TOPS acquisitions relative to the reference coordinate system. We develop a workflow to estimate the time series of azimuth misregistration using a network-based enhanced spectral diversity (NESD) approach, in order to reduce the impact of temporal decorrelation on coregistration. Example time series of misregistration inferred for five tracks of Sentinel-1 TOPS acquisitions indicates a maximum relative azimuth misregistration of less than 0.01 of the full azimuth resolution between the TOPS acquisitions in the studied areas. Standard deviation of the estimated misregistration time series for different stacks varies from 1.1e-3 to 2e-3 of the azimuth resolution, equivalent to 1.6-2.8 cm orbital uncertainty in the azimuth direction. These values fall within the 1-sigma orbital uncertainty of the Sentinel-1 orbits and imply that orbital uncertainty is most likely the main source of the constant azimuth misregistration between different TOPS acquisitions. We propagate the uncertainty of individual misregistration estimated with ESD to the misregistration time series estimated with NESD and investigate the different challenges for operationalizing NESD.","author":[{"family":"Fattahi","given":"Heresh"},{"family":"Agram","given":"Piyush"},{"family":"Simons","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"Fattahi.etal_2016_NetworkBasedEnhanced","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","DOI":"10.1109/TGRS.2016.2614925","ISSN":"1558-0644","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",12]]},"note":"ZSCC:00100","page":"777-786","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"A Network-Based Enhanced Spectral Diversity Approach for TOPS Time-Series Analysis","type":"article-journal","volume":"55"},
  {"id":"Fattahi.etal_2017_InSARTimeSeries","abstract":"Repeat pass interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations may be significantly impacted by the propagation delay of the microwave signal through the ionosphere, which is commonly referred to as ionospheric delay. The dispersive character of the ionosphere at microwave frequencies allows one to estimate the ionospheric delay from InSAR data through a split range-spectrum technique. Here, we extend the existing split range-spectrum technique to InSAR time-series. We present an algorithm for estimating a time-series of ionospheric phase delay that is useful for correcting InSAR time-series of ground surface displacement or for evaluating the spatial and temporal variations of the ionosphere's total electron content (TEC). Experimental results from stacks of L-band SAR data acquired by the ALOS-1 Japanese satellite show significant ionospheric phase delay equivalent to 2 m of the temporal variation of InSAR time-series along 445 km in Chile, a region at low latitudes where large TEC variations are common. The observed delay is significantly smaller, with a maximum of 10 cm over 160 km, in California. The estimation and correction of ionospheric delay reduces the temporal variation of the InSAR time-series to centimeter levels in Chile. The ionospheric delay correction of the InSAR time-series reveals earthquake-induced ground displacement, which otherwise could not be detected. A comparison with independent GPS time-series demonstrates an order of magnitude reduction in the root mean square difference between GPS and InSAR after correcting for ionospheric delay. The results show that the presented algorithm significantly improves the accuracy of InSAR time-series and should become a routine component of InSAR time-series analysis.","author":[{"family":"Fattahi","given":"Heresh"},{"family":"Simons","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Agram","given":"Piyush"}],"citation-key":"Fattahi.etal_2017_InSARTimeSeries","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","DOI":"10.1109/TGRS.2017.2718566","ISSN":"1558-0644","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",10]]},"note":"ZSCC:00078","page":"5984-5996","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"InSAR Time-Series Estimation of the Ionospheric Phase Delay: An Extension of the Split Range-Spectrum Technique","title-short":"InSAR Time-Series Estimation of the Ionospheric Phase Delay","type":"article-journal","volume":"55"},

  {"id":"Fialko.etal_2001_DeformationDue","abstract":"We consider deformation due to sill-like magma intrusions using a model of a horizontal circular crack in a semi-inﬁnite elastic solid. We present exact expressions for vertical and horizontal displacements of the free surface of a half-space, and calculate surface displacements for a special case of a uniformly pressurized crack. We derive expressions for other observable geophysical parameters, such as the volume of a surface uplift/ subsidence, and the corresponding volume change due to ﬂuid injection/withdrawal at depth. We demonstrate that for essentially oblate (i.e. sill-like) source geometries the volume change at the source always equals the volume of the displaced material at the surface of a half-space. Our solutions compare favourably to a number of previously published approximate models. Surface deformation due to a ‘point’ crack (that is, a crack with a large depth-to-radius ratio) differs appreciably from that due to an isotropic point source (‘Mogi model’). Geodetic inversions that employ only one component of deformation (either vertical or horizontal) are unlikely to resolve the overall geometry of subsurface deformation sources even in a simplest case of axisymmetric deformation. Measurements of a complete vector displacement ﬁeld at the Earth’s surface may help to constrain the depth and morphology of active magma reservoirs. However, our results indicate that differences in surface displacements due to various axisymmetric sources may be subtle. In particular, the sill-like and pluton-like magma chambers may give rise to differences in the ratio of maximum horizontal displacements to maximum vertical displacements (a parameter that is most indicative of the source geometry) that are less than 30 per cent. Given measurement errors in geodetic data, such differences may be hard to distinguish.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Fialko","given":"Yuri"},{"family":"Khazan","given":"Yakov"},{"family":"Simons","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"Fialko.etal_2001_DeformationDue","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1046/j.1365-246X.2001.00452.x","ISSN":"0956540X, 1365246X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",7]]},"language":"en","page":"181-190","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Deformation due to a pressurized horizontal circular crack in an elastic half-space, with applications to volcano geodesy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/gji/article-lookup/doi/10.1046/j.1365-246X.2001.00452.x","volume":"146"},
  {"id":"Fialko.etal_2001_FiniteSource","abstract":"We investigate surface deformation associated with currently active crustal magma bodies in Socorro, New Mexico, and Long Valley, California, USA. We invert available geodetic data from these locations to constrain the overall geometry and dynamics of the inferred deformation sources at depth. Our best-ﬁtting model for the Socorro magma body is a sill with a depth of 19 km, an effective diameter of 70 km and a rate of increase in the excess magma pressure of 0.6 kPa yrx1. We show that the corresponding volumetric inﬂation rate is y6r10x3 km3 yrx1, which is considerably less than previously suggested. The measured inﬂation rate of the Socorro magma body may result from a steady inﬂux of magma from a deep source, or a volume increase associated with melting of the magma chamber roof (i.e. crustal anatexis). In the latter case, the most recent major injection of mantle-derived melts into the middle crust beneath Socorro may have occurred within the last several tens to several hundreds of years. The Synthetic Interferometric Aperture Radar (InSAR) data collected in the area of the Long Valley caldera, CA, between June 1996 and July 1998 reveal an intracaldera uplift with a maximum amplitude of y11 cm and a volume of 3.5r10x2 km3. Modelling of the InSAR data suggests that the observed deformation might be due to either a sill-like magma body at a depth of y12 km or a pluton-like magma body at a depth of y8 km beneath the resurgent dome. Assuming that the caldera ﬁll deforms as an isotropic linear elastic solid, a joint inversion of the InSAR data and two-colour laser geodimeter data (which provide independent constraints on horizontal displacements at the surface) suggests that the inferred magma chamber is a steeply dipping prolate spheroid with a depth of 7–9 km and an aspect ratio in excess of 2:1. Our results highlight the need for large radar look angles and multiple look directions in future InSAR missions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Fialko","given":"Yuri"},{"family":"Simons","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Khazan","given":"Yakov"}],"citation-key":"Fialko.etal_2001_FiniteSource","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1046/j.1365-246X.2001.00453.x","ISSN":"0956540X, 1365246X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",7]]},"language":"en","page":"191-200","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Finite source modelling of magmatic unrest in Socorro, New Mexico, and Long Valley, California","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/gji/article-lookup/doi/10.1046/j.1365-246X.2001.00453.x","volume":"146"},

  {"id":"Fichtner.Tkalcic_2010_InsightsKinematics","abstract":"The accurate modelling and prediction of volcanic eruptions depends critically on information concerning the interaction between the caldera and the underlying magma chamber. Knowledge concerning the kinematics of a caldera in the course of an eruption is therefore essential. Here we provide detailed seismological constraints on the kinematics of a volcanic caldera drop and the geometry of a caldera ring fault. For this we performed a finite-source inversion of the September 29, 1996 Bárdarbunga, Iceland, earthquake that was caused by caldera subsidence. Our methodology is based on spectral element simulations of seismic wave propagation through a realistic model of the Icelandic crust and upper mantle. A particularly robust feature is the initiation of the rupture in the north-western part of the ring fault that is about 10km in diameter. From there it spread to the other fault segments within about 3s. Without invoking super-shear propagation sensu stricto, we can explain this unusually fast rupture propagation by the triggering of fault segments through P waves that propagated across the caldera. Our results favour outward-dipping fault segments in the western half of the ring fault, while the eastern half is preferentially inward-dipping. This variability may reflect structural heterogeneities or an irregular magma chamber geometry. The individual segments of the caldera ring fault radiated approximately equal amounts of energy. This indicates that the caldera dropped coherently as one single block. The work presented here is intended to aid in the design of realistic models of magma chamber and caldera dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Fichtner","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Tkalčić","given":"Hrvoje"}],"citation-key":"Fichtner.Tkalcic_2010_InsightsKinematics","container-title":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","container-title-short":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","DOI":"10.1016/j.epsl.2010.07.013","ISSN":"0012-821X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",9,1]]},"page":"607-615","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Insights into the kinematics of a volcanic caldera drop: Probabilistic finite-source inversion of the 1996 Bárdarbunga, Iceland, earthquake","title-short":"Insights into the kinematics of a volcanic caldera drop","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X10004516","volume":"297"},

We integrated geodetic measurements for the 3D vector field of coseismic surface deformation for the two events, using SAR data from Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 satellites. We combined less precise large-scale displacements from SAR images by pixel offset tracking or matching, including the along-track component, with the more precise SAR interferometry (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar [InSAR]) measurements in the radar line of sight (LoS) direction and intermediate-precision along-track InSAR to estimate all three components of the surface displacement for the two events together. We also estimated the coseismic deformation for the two earthquakes from time-series processing of continuous Global Navigation Satellite System data stations in the area. InSAR coherence and coherence change maps the surface disruptions due to fault ruptures reaching the surface. Large slip in the Mw 6.4 earthquake was on a NE-striking fault that intersects with the NW-striking fault that was the main rupture in the Mw 7.1 earthquake. The main fault bifurcates towards the southeast ending 3 km from the Garlock Fault. The Garlock fault had triggered slip of about 20 mm in the radar LoS along a short section directly south of the main rupture. About 3 km northwest of the Mw 7.1 epicenter, the surface fault separates into two strands that form a pull-apart with about 1 m of downdrop.

Dehydration embrittlement is thought to be responsible for earthquakes in the subducting crust (upper layer), but the case for it in the lithospheric mantle (lower layer) is less clear. We apply a recently developed relative relocation technique to characterize seismicity in 32 slab segments. The high-precision hypocentral depths allow us to assign events to either the upper or lower layer and to separately estimate frequency size distributions for each plane. We find consistently larger b values, correlating with slab age, for the upper layer and roughly constant values for the lower. We also show that thermal parameter and plate age are the key controls on double seismic zone geometry.

  {"id":"Garfunkel_2014_LateralMotion","abstract":"This paper presents an updated summary of the history and shallow structure of the Dead Sea transform (DST) and its plate tectonic context. The DST formed in the Early Miocene as a transform boundary between the Sinai and Arabian plates. The lateral offset was ca. 105 km near the Dead Sea. Since the DST trace is irregular in map view, the lateral motion led to formation of a 10–80 km wide deformation zone along the plate junction. Thus, the structures along the DST can be interpreted within the framework of the Sinai-Arabia plate kinematics. South of ca. lat. 33° transtension, which increased with time, led to variable oblique separation of the plate edges. This produced an almost continuous ca. 5–25 km wide depression whose structure is dominated by a string of pull-apart basins up to 15–20 km wide and up to ca. 12 km deep. The crystalline crust under the largest basins was appreciably thinned and may have been intruded by basalts. The structural pattern changed over time, the present pattern having been mostly established in the second half of the DST history. North of lat. ca. 33°N transpression dominates and the DST flanks are strongly deformed by folding, faulting, and rotation of fault blocks on vertical axes, which together produce shortening perpendicular to the DST and also left lateral shearing of its flanks, qualitatively compatible with the plate kinematic. The deformation can also account for the observed decrease of the lateral offset along the main fault line from ca. 100 km at ca. lat 33°N to 65–70 km at lat. 36°–36.5°N, and also leads to left lateral shearing along the continental margin near the Galilee and farther north. North of lat. 36.5°N the DST now interacts with the Anatolian plate and the Cyprus arc. This resulted from a rearrangement of the plate configuration in that region when westward extrusion of Anatolia began and the East Anatolian Fault formed, but the details of the kinematic changes are incompletely known. This change obscured the structural relations in this region during the early stages of the DST history.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Garfunkel","given":"Zvi"}],"citation-key":"Garfunkel_2014_LateralMotion","collection-title":"Modern Approaches in Solid Earth Sciences","container-title":"Dead Sea Transform Fault System: Reviews","DOI":"10.1007/978-94-017-8872-4_5","editor":[{"family":"Garfunkel","given":"Zvi"},{"family":"Ben-Avraham","given":"Zvi"},{"family":"Kagan","given":"Elisa"}],"event-place":"Dordrecht","ISBN":"978-94-017-8872-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC:00071","page":"109-150","publisher":"Springer Netherlands","publisher-place":"Dordrecht","source":"Springer Link","title":"Lateral Motion and Deformation Along the Dead Sea Transform","type":"chapter","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-8872-4_5"},
  {"id":"Garfunkel.Ben-Avraham_1996_StructureDead","abstract":"The Dead Sea basin is located along the left-lateral transform boundary between the Arabian and Sinai plates. Its structure and history are known from surface geology, drilling, seismic reflection and other geophysical data. The basin comprises a large pull-apart, almost 150 km long and mostly 8–10 km wide, which is flanked by a few kilometres wide zones of normal faulting. The basin formed at about 15 Ma or earlier, close to the beginning of the transform motion, and it reached about half its present length before the end of the Miocene. A strong negative gravity anomaly records a thick sediment basin fill: > 5 km under half its length, reaching a maximum of ≥ 10 km. The fill includes a few km of salt (ca. 6-4 Ma) which forms several diapirs. At any one time large parts of the basin subsided simultaneously, but the site of fastest subsidence seems to have shifted northward. Sedimentation rates reached at least hundreds of metres per million years or more in the Miocene, and ≥ 1 km/Myr in later periods. The basin structure is dominated by longitudinal faults: intrabasinal faults which delimit the pull-apart and which are the extensions of the major strike-slip faults north and south of the basin, and normal faults which extend along the basin margins. The latter faults express a small component of extension across the basin, whereas the pull-apart resulted from the much larger lateral motion along the basin. In addition, transverse faults divide the pull-apart into several segments with somewhat different histories. The pull-apart grew by becoming longer parallel to the transform motion. At shallow levels this was probably achieved by normal slip on transverse listric faults while the fill between them was little deformed.

  {"id":"Geshi_2009_AsymmetricGrowth","abstract":"Oblique development of the ring faults reflecting the structural heterogeneities inside the volcano formed many asymmetric structures of Miyakejima 2000 AD caldera. The asymmetry includes (a) offset location of the ring faults with respect to the associated shallow magma chamber, (b) unequal outward migration of the caldera wall 600 m at the southeastern rim but only 200 m at the northwestern rim, (c) development of tilted terrace only at the southeastern caldera margin, (d) eruption sites and fumaroles being confined to the southern part of the caldera. Geophysical data, including ground deformation and seismic activity, indicates the offset of the location of the magma chamber about 2 km south of the caldera center on the surface. The ring faults propagated from the deflating magma chamber obliquely about 30 degrees toward the summit. The oblique subsidence of the cylindrical block formed a wider instable zone, particularly in the southeastern side of the ring fault that enhanced the larger outward migration of the caldera rim and also caused the formation of the outer half-ring fault bordering the tilting slope at the southern part. Ascending pass of the buoyant magma along the tilted ring faults was concentrated in the southern half of the caldera and consequently the distributions of the eruption sites and fumaroles are localized in the southern-half part of the caldera. The structure of the Miyakejima 2000 caldera with complete development of the ring faults, its high roof aspect ratio and oblique subsidence is clearly distinguishable from trapdoor-type caldera. The oblique development of the ring faults can be controlled by the mechanical contrast between the solidified conduits and surrounding fragile volcanic edifice. Asymmetric development of the Miyakejima caldera shows that the collapsed calderas are potential indicators of the heterogeneous structures inside of the volcano, particularly in the case of small-size caldera.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Geshi","given":"Nobuo"}],"citation-key":"Geshi_2009_AsymmetricGrowth","container-title":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","container-title-short":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","DOI":"10.1016/j.epsl.2009.01.027","ISSN":"0012-821X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",4,15]]},"page":"149-158","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Asymmetric growth of collapsed caldera by oblique subsidence during the 2000 eruption of Miyakejima, Japan","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X0900051X","volume":"280"},
  {"id":"Geshi.etal_2002_CalderaCollapse","abstract":"A collapsed caldera, 1.6 km in diameter and 450 m in depth, was formed at the summit of Miyakejima Volcano during the 2000 eruption. The collapsed caldera appeared on 8 July, with a minor phreatic eruption, 12 days after seismic activity and magma intrusion occurred northwest of the volcano. Growth of the caldera took from 8 July to the middle of August, with seismic swarms associated with the continuous intrusion of magma northwest of the volcano. The growth rate of the caldera was about 1.4×107 m3/day, and the final volume of the collapsed caldera was about 6×108 m3. Major phreatomagmatic eruptions produced a total of about 1.6×1010 kg (1.1×107 m3) of volcanic ash after caldera growth. The caldera structure, and the nature of the eruptive materials of the first collapse on 8 July, suggest that the surface subsidence was caused by the upward migration of a steam-filled cavity, with stoping of the roof rock above the magma reservoir. The diameter of the stoping column was estimated to be 600–700 m from circumferential faults that developed in the caldera floor, and the collapse of the caldera wall enlarged the diameter of the caldera to 1.6 km. The total volume of the caldera and the horizontal diameter of the stoping column gave a subsidence of the caldera floor of 1.6–2.1 km.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Geshi","given":"N."},{"family":"Shimano","given":"T."},{"family":"Chiba","given":"T."},{"family":"Nakada","given":"S."}],"citation-key":"Geshi.etal_2002_CalderaCollapse","container-title":"Bulletin of Volcanology","container-title-short":"Bull Volcanol","DOI":"10.1007/s00445-001-0184-z","ISSN":"0258-8900, 1432-0819","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"55-68","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Caldera collapse during the 2000 eruption of Miyakejima Volcano, Japan","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00445-001-0184-z","volume":"64"},
  {"id":"Geyer.etal_2006_RelationshipCaldera","abstract":"Collapse calderas have received considerable attention due to their link to Earth's ore deposits and geothermal energy resources, but also because of their tremendous destructive potential. Although calderas have been investigated through fieldwork, numerical models and experimental studies, some important aspects on their formation still remain poorly understood. One key issue concerns the volume of magmas involved in caldera-forming eruptions. We perform analogue experiments to correlate the structural evolution of a collapse with the erupted magma chamber volume fraction. The experimental device consists of a transparent box (60×60×40 cm) filled with dry quartz sand and a water-filled latex balloon as a magma chamber analogue. Evacuation of water through a pipe causes a progressive deflation of the balloon that leads to a collapse of the overlying structure. The experimental design allows to record the temporal evolution of the collapse and to track the evolution of fractures and faults. We study the appearance and development of specific brittle structures, such as surface fractures or internal reverse faults, and correlate each different structure with the corresponding removed magma chamber volume fraction. We also determine the critical conditions for caldera onset. Experimental results show that, at any stage of caldera developments, the experimental relationship between volume fraction and chamber roof aspect ratio fits a logarithmic curve. It implies that volume fractions required to trigger caldera collapse are lower for chambers with low aspect ratios (shallow and wide) than for chambers with high aspect ratios (deep and small). These results are in agreement with natural examples and previous theoretical studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Geyer","given":"A."},{"family":"Folch","given":"A."},{"family":"Martí","given":"J."}],"citation-key":"Geyer.etal_2006_RelationshipCaldera","container-title":"Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research","container-title-short":"Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research","DOI":"10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2006.05.001","ISSN":"0377-0273","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",10,1]]},"page":"375-386","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Relationship between caldera collapse and magma chamber withdrawal: An experimental approach","title-short":"Relationship between caldera collapse and magma chamber withdrawal","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377027306002198","volume":"157"},

  {"id":"Gibbons.Ringdal_2006_DetectionLow","abstract":"It has long been accepted that occurrences of a known signal are most effectively detected by cross-correlating the incoming data stream with a waveform template. Such matched signal detectors have received very little attention in the ﬁeld of detection seismology because there are relatively few instances in which the form of an anticipated seismic signal is known a priori. Repeating events in highly conﬁned geographical regions have been observed to produce very similar waveforms and good signals from events at a given site can be exploited to detect subsequent co-located events at lower magnitudes than would be possible using traditional power detectors. Even greater improvement in signal detectability can be achieved using seismic arrays; running correlation coefﬁcients from single sensors can be stacked over an array or network to result in a network correlation coefﬁcient displaying a signiﬁcant array gain. If two events are co-located, the time separating the corresponding patterns in the wave train as indicated by the cross-correlation function is identical for all seismic stations and this property means that the correlation coefﬁcient traces are coherent even when the waveforms are not. We illustrate the power of array-based waveform correlation using the 1997 August 16 Kara Sea event. The weak event that occurred 4 hr after the main event was barely detected using an STA/LTA detector on the SPITS array but is readily detected by signal matching on a single channel. The main event was also recorded by the far more distant NORSAR array but no conventional detection can be made for the second event. A clear detection is, however, made when the correlation coefﬁcient traces are beamformed over all sensors of the array. We estimate the reduction in detection threshold of a test signal on a regional seismic array using waveform correlation by scaling down a master signal and immersing it into seismic noise. We show that, for this case, waveform correlation using a single channel detects signals of approximately 0.7 orders of magnitude lower than is possible using an STA/LTA detector on the array beam. Waveform matching on the full array provides an additional improvement of approximately 0.4 magnitude units. We describe a case study in which small seismic events at the Barentsburg coal mine on Spitsbergen were detected using the signals from a major rockburst as master waveforms. Many spurious triggers occurred in this study whereby short sections of signal exhibited coincidental similarity with unrelated incoming wave fronts. We demonstrate how such false alarms can almost always be identiﬁed and screened out automatically by performing frequency–wavenumber analysis upon the set of individual correlation coefﬁcient traces.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Gibbons","given":"Steven J."},{"family":"Ringdal","given":"Frode"}],"citation-key":"Gibbons.Ringdal_2006_DetectionLow","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2006.02865.x","ISSN":"0956540X, 1365246X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",4]]},"language":"en","page":"149-166","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The detection of low magnitude seismic events using array-based waveform correlation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/gji/article-lookup/doi/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2006.02865.x","volume":"165"},

Localized reductions in slip rate occur where the Sinai Plate is in ∼N–S extension. Extension is conﬁned to the Sinai side of the fault and is associated with prominent changes in transform geometry, and with NW–SE striking, left-lateral splay faults, including the Carmel Fault in Israel and the Roum Fault in Lebanon. The asymmetry of the extensional velocity gradients about the transform reﬂects active fragmentation of the Sinai Plate along the continental margin.

  {"id":"Gong.Fan_2022_SeismicityFault","abstract":"Oceanic transform faults accommodate plate motions through both seismic and aseismic slips. However, deformation partition and slip mode interaction at these faults remain elusive mainly limited by rare observations. We use 1-year ocean bottom seismometer data collected in 2008 to detect and locate earthquakes at the westernmost Gofar transform fault. The ultra-fast slipping rate of Gofar results in ∼30,000 earthquakes during the observational period, providing an excellent opportunity to investigate interrelations between the slip mode, seismicity, and fault architecture at an unprecedented resolution. Earthquake distribution indicates that the ∼100-km-long Gofar transform fault is distinctly segmented into five zones, including one zone contouring a M6 earthquake that was captured by the experiment. Further, a barrier zone east of the M6 earthquake hosted abundant foreshocks preceding the M6 event and halted its active seismicity afterward. The barrier zone has two layers of earthquakes at depth, and they responded to the M6 earthquake differently. Additionally, a zone connecting to the East Pacific Rise had quasi-periodic earthquake swarms. The seismicity segmentation suggests that the Gofar fault has multiple slip modes occurring in adjacent fault patches. Spatiotemporal characteristics of the earthquakes suggest that complex fault architecture and fluid–rock interaction play primary roles in modulating the slip modes at Gofar, possibly involving multiple concurrent physical processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Gong","given":"Jianhua"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Wenyuan"}],"citation-key":"Gong.Fan_2022_SeismicityFault","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","container-title-short":"JGR Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/2022JB024918","ISSN":"2169-9313, 2169-9356","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC:00002","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Seismicity, Fault Architecture, and Slip Mode of the Westernmost Gofar Transform Fault","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2022JB024918","volume":"127"},
  {"id":"Gong.McGuire_2022_WaveformSignatures","abstract":"Complex seismic velocity structure near the earthquake source can affect rupture dynamics and strongly modify the seismic waveforms recorded near the fault. Fault-zone waves are commonly observed in continental crustal settings but are less clear in subduction zones due to the spatial separation between seismic stations and the plate boundary fault. We observed anomalously long duration S waves from earthquake clusters located near the interface of the subducted Gorda plate north of the Mendocino triple junction. In contrast, earthquakes located just a few kilometers below each cluster show impulsive S waves. A nodal array experiment was conducted around the Northern California Seismic Network station KCT for two months to investigate the origin of the complex S waves. Beamforming analysis shows that the S waves contain three arrivals that have different horizontal slownesses, which we term S1, S2, and S coda. Similar analysis on P waves also show two arrivals with different horizontal slownesses, which we term P1 and P2. P1 and S1 have larger horizontal slowness than P2 and S2, respectively, indicating that the phase pairs are body waves with different ray paths. Building upon a seismic refraction profile, we construct 1D velocity models and test different thicknesses and VP= VS ratios for the subducted oceanic crust. The arrival times and relative slownesses of P1/P2 and S1/S2 phases indicate that they are the direct and the Moho reflected phases, respectively. Their properties are consistent with a crustal thickness of ∼ 6 km and a moderate VP= VS ratio ( ∼ 1.8). The S coda is more difficult to characterize but has a clear dominant frequency that likely reflects the near-source velocity and attenuation structure. Our study indicates that waveforms from earthquakes near the interface of the subducted slab can be used to infer detailed structural information about the plate-boundary zone at seismogenic depths.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Gong","given":"Jianhua"},{"family":"McGuire","given":"Jeffrey J."}],"citation-key":"Gong.McGuire_2022_WaveformSignatures","container-title":"Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America","DOI":"10.1785/0120210261","ISSN":"0037-1106, 1943-3573","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,1]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Waveform Signatures of Earthquakes Located Close to the Subducted Gorda Plate Interface","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/bssa/article/doi/10.1785/0120210261/614881/Waveform-Signatures-of-Earthquakes-Located-Close"},

We determine the geometry of the dike and neighboring magma chambers and invert for the distribution of opening of the dike, as well as slip on rift border faults. The volume of the 2005 dike (1.5–2.0 km3) is not balanced by sufficient volume loss at Dabbahu and Gabho volcanoes (0.42 and 0.12 km3, respectively). Taking into account the deflation of a suspected deep midsegment magma chamber simultaneously to dike intrusion produces a smoother opening distribution along the southern segment. Above the dike, faults slipped by an average 3 m, yielding an estimated geodetic moment of 3.5 × 1019 Nm, one order of magnitude larger than the cumulative seismic moment released during the earthquake swarm. Between Dabbahu and Ado'Ale volcanic complexes, significant opening occurred on the western side of the dike. The anomalous location of the dike at this latitude, offset to the east of the axial depression, may explain this phenomenon. A two-stage intrusion scenario is proposed, whereby rifting in the northern Manda Hararo Rift was triggered by magma upwelling in the Dabbahu area, at the northern extremity of the magmatic segment. Although vigorous dike injection occurred during the September 2005 event, the tectonic stress deficit since the previous rifting episode was not fully released, leading to further intrusions in 2006–2009.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Grandin","given":"R."},{"family":"Socquet","given":"A."},{"family":"Binet","given":"R."},{"family":"Klinger","given":"Y."},{"family":"Jacques","given":"E."},{"family":"Chabalier","given":"J.-B.","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"King","given":"G.

This makes along-track displacements, and subsequently north-south displacements, difficult to measure using conventional split-beam (multiple-aperture) InSAR or cross-correlation techniques. Alternatively, we show here that the along-track component of ground motion can be deduced from the double difference between backward and forward looking interferograms within regions of burst overlap. “Burst overlap interferometry” takes advantage of the large squint angle diversity of Sentinel-1 (∼1°) to achieve subdecimetric accuracy on the along-track component of ground motion.

  {"id":"Gregg.etal_2012_CatastrophicCalderaforming","abstract":"Approximately every 100,000 years the Earth experiences catastrophic caldera-forming “supereruptions” that are considered to be one of the most hazardous natural events on Earth. Utilizing new temperature-dependent, viscoelastic numerical models that incorporate a Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion, we ﬁnd that eruptive failure of the largest magma chambers is a function of the geometry of the overlying roof and the location of the brittle-ductile transition. In particular, the ductile halo created around the hot magma chamber buffers increasing overpressures and prevents pressure relief via magmatic injection from the magma chamber. The numerical results indicate that as chamber volume increases, the higher temperatures in the host rock and the decrease in the roof aspect ratio cause a shift from reservoir-triggered eruption to an external roof-triggered mechanism. Speciﬁcally, as overpressure increases within the largest magma chambers, extensive uplift in the overlying roof promotes the development of through-going faults that may trigger eruption and caldera collapse from above. We ﬁnd that for magma chamber volumes > 103 km3, and roof aspect ratios (depth/width)b 0.3, moderate magma chamber overpressures (b 30 MPa) will cause extensive through-going fault development in the overlying roof. This result indicates an external mechanism, caused by fault propagation in the roof, is a likely trigger for the largest caldera forming eruptions. The thermomechanical models also provide an estimate of the maximum size of magma chamber growth in a pristine host material and, thus, an estimate of the maximum size of the resultant caldera. We ﬁnd a maximum reservoir volume range of 104–105 km3 for shallow crustal magma chambers emplaced at depths to the top of the magma chamber of 3–7 km. These volumes produce maximum caldera areas of 103–104 km2, comparable to the largest calderas observed on Earth (e.g., Toba). These thermomechanical models offer critical new insight into the mechanics of catastrophic caldera collapse and provide a numerical construct for predicting how eruption is triggered in the largest crustal magma chambers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Gregg","given":"P.M."},{"family":"Silva","given":"S.L.","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Grosfils","given":"E.B."},{"family":"Parmigiani","given":"J.P."}],"citation-key":"Gregg.etal_2012_CatastrophicCalderaforming","container-title":"Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research","container-title-short":"Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research","DOI":"10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2012.06.009","ISSN":"03770273","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",10]]},"language":"en","page":"1-12","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Catastrophic caldera-forming eruptions: Thermomechanics and implications for eruption triggering and maximum caldera dimensions on Earth","title-short":"Catastrophic caldera-forming eruptions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0377027312001692","volume":"241-242"},

We use a principal component decomposition-based inversion method to study the space- and time-dependent evolution of slip on faults without any a priori assumption on the model used to characterize the temporal evolution of crustal deformation. The method adopted allows us to account for the initial post-seismic deformation in estimating the coseismic displacements, in a consistent manner for the whole GPS network. We use elastic dislocation theory and a least-squares procedure to invert for the slip distribution on the mainshock fault (Paganica fault) and a second fault (Campotosto fault), where a Mw 5.2 aftershock occurred on April 9. The geometries for these faults are obtained from a singular value decomposition of precisely relocated aftershocks. We find that the use of complex fault geometries is not justified by the GPS observations available. An inversion that accounts for post-seismic slip to occur on both the Paganica and Campotosto faults provides a better fit to the GPS time-series observations, than using only the Paganica fault segment, at a 95 per cent confidence level. Within our resolution, afterslip regions do not migrate over time and are localized on fault patches that are approximately complementary to those of coseismic slip. We find that the position of some relevant afterslip patches is different if the inversion is performed assuming a fixed rake or not. We estimate the parameter a – b of rate- and state-dependent friction on those fault regions accommodating afterslip that are robustly characterized in our inversions. We find values of the order of 10−3, which is near the transition from potentially unstable to nominally stable friction. These results are in agreement with laboratory measurements performed on typical rocks of the L'Aquila region.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Gualandi","given":"A."},{"family":"Serpelloni","given":"E."},{"family":"Belardinelli","given":"M.

  {"id":"Gualandi.etal_2016_BlindSource","abstract":"A critical point in the analysis of ground displacement time series, as those recorded by space geodetic techniques, is the development of data-driven methods that allow the different sources of deformation to be discerned and characterized in the space and time domains. Multivariate statistic includes several approaches that can be considered as a part of data-driven methods. A widely used technique is the principal component analysis (PCA), which allows us to reduce the dimensionality of the data space while maintaining most of the variance of the dataset explained. However, PCA does not perform well in finding the solution to the so-called blind source separation (BSS) problem, i.e., in recovering and separating the original sources that generate the observed data. This is mainly due to the fact that PCA minimizes the misfit calculated using an $$L_{2}$$norm ($$\\chi ^{2})$$, looking for a new Euclidean space where the projected data are uncorrelated. The independent component analysis (ICA) is a popular technique adopted to approach the BSS problem. However, the independence condition is not easy to impose, and it is often necessary to introduce some approximations. To work around this problem, we test the use of a modified variational Bayesian ICA (vbICA) method to recover the multiple sources of ground deformation even in the presence of missing data. The vbICA method models the probability density function (pdf) of each source signal using a mix of Gaussian distributions, allowing for more flexibility in the description of the pdf of the sources with respect to standard ICA, and giving a more reliable estimate of them. Here we present its application to synthetic global positioning system (GPS) position time series, generated by simulating deformation near an active fault, including inter-seismic, co-seismic, and post-seismic signals, plus seasonal signals and noise, and an additional time-dependent volcanic source. We evaluate the ability of the PCA and ICA decomposition techniques in explaining the data and in recovering the original (known) sources. Using the same number of components, we find that the vbICA method fits the data almost as well as a PCA method, since the $$\\chi ^{2}$$increase is less than 10 % the value calculated using a PCA decomposition. Unlike PCA, the vbICA algorithm is found to correctly separate the sources if the correlation of the dataset is low ($$<$$0.67) and the geodetic network is sufficiently dense (ten continuous GPS stations within a box of side equal to two times the locking depth of a fault where an earthquake of $$M_\\mathrm{{w}} >6$$occurred). We also provide a cookbook for the use of the vbICA algorithm in analyses of position time series for tectonic and non-tectonic applications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Gualandi","given":"A."},{"family":"Serpelloni","given":"E."},{"family":"Belardinelli","given":"M.

The records show strong seasonal variations due to surface hydrology. After corrections for these variations, the time series covering the pre- and post-seismic periods do not show any detectable transient pre-seismic displacement. By contrast, a transient post-seismic signal is clear. The observed signal shows southward displacements consistent with afterslip on the MHT. Using additional data from stations deployed after the mainshock, we invert the time series for the spatio-temporal evolution of slip on the MHT. This modelling indicates afterslip dominantly downdip of the mainshock rupture. Two other regions show significant afterslip: a more minor zone updip of the rupture, and a region between the mainshock and the largest aftershock ruptures. Afterslip in the first ~7months after the mainshock released a moment of [12.8±0.5]×1019Nm which represents 17.8±0.8% of the co-seismic moment. The moment released by aftershocks over that period of time is estimated to 2.98×1019Nm. Geodetically observed post-seismic deformation after co-seismic offset correction was thus 76.7±1.0% aseismic. The logarithmic time evolution of afterslip is consistent with rate-strengthening frictional sliding. According to this theory, and assuming a long-term loading velocity modulated on the basis of the coupling map of the region and the long term slip rate of 20.2±1.1mm/yr, afterslip should release about 34.0±1.4% of the co-seismic moment after full relaxation of post-seismic deformation. Afterslip contributed to loading the shallower portion of the MHT which did not rupture in 2015 and stayed locked afterwards. The risk for further large earthquakes in Nepal remains high both updip of the rupture area of the Gorkha earthquake and West of Kathmandu where the MHT has remained locked and where no earthquake larger than Mw7.5 has occurred since 1505.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Gualandi","given":"Adriano"},{"family":"Avouac","given":"Jean-Philippe"},{"family":"Galetzka","given":"John"},{"family":"Genrich","given":"Joachim F."},{"family":"Blewitt","given":"Geoffrey"},{"family":"Adhikari","given":"Lok Bijaya"},{"family":"Koirala","given":"Bharat Prasad"},{"family":"Gupta","given":"Ratnamani"},{"family":"Upreti","given":"Bishal Nath"},{"family":"Pratt-Sitaula","given":"Beth"},{"family":"Liu-Zeng","given":"Jing"}],"citation-key":"Gualandi.etal_2017_PrePostseismic","collection-title":"Special Issue on the 25 April 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha (Nepal) Earthquake","container-title":"Tectonophysics","container-title-short":"Tectonophysics","DOI":"10.1016/j.tecto.2016.06.014","ISSN":"0040-1951","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,13]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC:00093","page":"90-106","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Pre- and post-seismic deformation related to the 2015, Mw7.8 Gorkha earthquake, Nepal","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040195116302207","volume":"714-715"},

We study frictional stick-slip events, which are the lab equivalent of earthquakes, via dynamical system tools in order to retrieve information on the underlying dynamics and to assess whether there are dynamical changes associated with the transition from stable to unstable motion. We find that the seismic cycle exhibits characteristics of a low-dimensional system with average dimension similar to that of natural slow earthquakes (<5). We also investigate local properties of the attractor and find maximum instantaneous dimension ≳10, indicating that some regions of the phase space require a high number of degrees of freedom (dofs). Our analysis does not preclude deterministic chaos, but the lab seismic cycle is best explained by a random attractor based on rate- and state-dependent friction whose dynamics is stochastically perturbed. We find that minimal variations of 0.05% of the shear and normal stresses applied to the experimental fault influence the large-scale dynamics and the recurrence time of labquakes. While complicated motion including period doubling is observed near the stability transition, even in the fully unstable regime we do not observe truly periodic behavior. Friction's nonlinear nature amplifies small scale perturbations, reducing the predictability of the otherwise periodic macroscopic dynamics. As applied to tectonic faults, our results imply that even small stress field fluctuations (≲150 kPa) can induce coefficient of variations in earthquake repeat time of a few percent. Moreover, these perturbations can drive an otherwise fast-slipping fault, close to the critical stability condition, into a mixed behavior involving slow and fast ruptures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Gualandi","given":"A."},{"family":"Faranda","given":"D."},{"family":"Marone","given":"C."},{"family":"Cocco","given":"M."},{"family":"Mengaldo","given":"G."}],"citation-key":"Gualandi.etal_2023_DeterministicStochastic","container-title":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","container-title-short":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","DOI":"10.1016/j.epsl.2023.117995","ISSN":"0012-821X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,15]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC:00000","page":"117995","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Deterministic and stochastic chaos characterize laboratory earthquakes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X23000080","volume":"604"},

  {"id":"Gudmundsson.etal_2014_DikeEmplacement","abstract":"A 45-km-long regional dike was emplaced over a period of 2 weeks in August 2014 at the boundary between the East and North Volcanic Zones in Iceland. This is the first regional dike emplacement in Iceland monitored with modern geophysical networks, the importance of which relates to regional dikes feeding most of the large fissure (e.g., Eldgja 934 and Laki 1783) and lava shield (e.g. early Holocene Skjaldbreidur and Trölladyngja) eruptions. During this time, the dike generated some 17,000 earthquakes, more than produced in Iceland as a whole over a normal year. The dike initiated close to the Bardarbunga Volcano but gradually extended to the northeast until it crossed the boundary between the East Volcanic Zone (EVZ) and the North Volcanic Zone (NVZ). We infer that the strike of the dike changes abruptly at a point, from about N45°E (coinciding with the trend of the EVZ) to N15°E (coinciding with the trend of the NVZ). This change in strike occurs at latitude 64.7°, exactly the same latitude at which about 10 Ma dikes in East Iceland change strike in a similar way. This suggests that the change in the regional stress field from the southern to the northern part of Iceland has been maintained at this latitude for 10 million years. Analytical and numerical models indicate that the dike-induced stress field results in stress concentration around faults and particularly shallow magma chambers and calderas in its vicinity, such as Tungnafellsjökull, Kverkfjöll, and Askja. In particular, the dike has induced high compressive, shear, and tensile stresses at the location of the Bardarbunga shallow chamber and (caldera) ring-fault where numerous earthquakes occurred during the dike emplacement, many of which have exceeded M5 (the largest M5.7). The first segment of the dike induced high tensile stresses in the nearby part of the Bardarbunga magma chamber/ring-fault resulting in radially outward injection of a dike from the chamber at a high angle to the strike of the regional dike. The location of maximum stress at Bardarbunga fluctuates along the chamber/ring-fault boundary in harmony with dike size and/or pressure changes and encourages ring-dike formation and associated magma flow within the chamber. Caldera collapse and/or eruption in some of these volcanoes is possible, most likely in Bardarbunga, but depends largely on the future development of the regional dike.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Gudmundsson","given":"Agust"},{"family":"Lecoeur","given":"Nora"},{"family":"Mohajeri","given":"Nahid"},{"family":"Thordarson","given":"Thorvaldur"}],"citation-key":"Gudmundsson.etal_2014_DikeEmplacement","container-title":"Bulletin of Volcanology","container-title-short":"Bull Volcanol","DOI":"10.1007/s00445-014-0869-8","ISSN":"0258-8900, 1432-0819","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"869","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Dike emplacement at Bardarbunga, Iceland, induces unusual stress changes, caldera deformation, and earthquakes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00445-014-0869-8","volume":"76"},
  {"id":"Gudmundsson.etal_2016_GradualCaldera","abstract":"Driven to collapse\nVolcanic eruptions occur frequently, but only rarely are they large enough to cause the top of the mountain to collapse and form a caldera. Gudmundsson et al. used a variety of geophysical tools to monitor the caldera formation that accompanied the 2014 Bárdarbunga volcanic eruption in Iceland. The volcanic edifice became unstable as magma from beneath Bárdarbunga spilled out into the nearby Holuhraun lava field. The timing of the gradual collapse revealed that it is the eruption that drives caldera formation and not the other way around.\nScience, this issue p. 262\nStructured Abstract\nINTRODUCTIONThe Bárdarbunga caldera volcano in central Iceland collapsed from August 2014 to February 2015 during the largest eruption in Europe since 1784. An ice-filled subsidence bowl, 110 square kilometers (km2) in area and up to 65 meters (m) deep developed, while magma drained laterally for 48 km along a subterranean path and erupted as a major lava flow northeast of the volcano. Our data provide unprecedented insight into the workings of a collapsing caldera.\nRATIONALECollapses of caldera volcanoes are, fortunately, not very frequent, because they are often associated with very large volcanic eruptions. On the other hand, the rarity of caldera collapses limits insight into this major geological hazard. Since the formation of Katmai caldera in 1912, during the 20th century’s largest eruption, only five caldera collapses are known to have occurred before that at Bárdarbunga. We used aircraft-based altimetry, satellite photogrammetry, radar interferometry, ground-based GPS, evolution of seismicity, radio-echo soundings of ice thickness, ice flow modeling, and geobarometry to describe and analyze the evolving subsidence geometry, its underlying cause, the amount of magma erupted, the geometry of the subsurface caldera ring faults, and the moment tensor solutions of the collapse-related earthquakes.\nRESULTSAfter initial lateral withdrawal of magma for some days though a magma-filled fracture propagating through Earth’s upper crust, preexisting ring faults under the volcano were reactivated over the period 20 to 24 August, marking the onset of collapse. On 31 August, the eruption started, and it terminated when the collapse stopped, having produced 1.5 km of basaltic lava. The subsidence of the caldera declined with time in a near-exponential manner, in phase with the lava flow rate.The volume of the subsidence bowl was about 1.8 km3. Using radio-echo soundings, we find that the subglacial bedrock surface after the collapse is down-sagged, with no indications of steep fault escarpments. Using geobarometry, we determined the depth of magma reservoir to be ~12 km, and modeling of geodetic observations gives a similar result. High-precision earthquake locations and moment tensor analysis of the remarkable magnitude M5 earthquake series are consistent with steeply dipping ring faults. Statistical analysis of seismicity reveals communication over tens of kilometers between the caldera and the dike.\nCONCLUSIONWe conclude that interaction between the pressure exerted by the subsiding reservoir roof and the physical properties of the subsurface flow path explain the gradual near-exponential decline of both the collapse rate and the intensity of the 180-day-long eruption. By combining our various data sets, we show that the onset of collapse was caused by outflow of magma from underneath the caldera when 12 to 20% of the total magma intruded and erupted had flowed from the magma reservoir. However, the continued subsidence was driven by a feedback between the pressure of the piston-like block overlying the reservoir and the 48-km-long magma outflow path. Our data provide better constraints on caldera mechanisms than previously available, demonstrating what caused the onset and how both the roof overburden and the flow path properties regulate the collapse. <img class=\"fragment-image\" src=\"https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/353/6296/aaf8988/F1.medium.gif\"/> Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint The Bárdarbunga caldera and the lateral magma flow path to the Holuhraun eruption site.(A) Aerial view of the ice-filled Bárdarbunga caldera on 24 October 2014, view from the north.

(C) A schematic cross section through the caldera and along the lateral subterranean flow path between the magma reservoir and the surface.\nLarge volcanic eruptions on Earth commonly occur with a collapse of the roof of a crustal magma reservoir, forming a caldera. Only a few such collapses occur per century, and the lack of detailed observations has obscured insight into the mechanical interplay between collapse and eruption. We use multiparameter geophysical and geochemical data to show that the 110-square-kilometer and 65-meter-deep collapse of Bárdarbunga caldera in 2014–2015 was initiated through withdrawal of magma, and lateral migration through a 48-kilometers-long dike, from a 12-kilometers deep reservoir. Interaction between the pressure exerted by the subsiding reservoir roof and the physical properties of the subsurface flow path explain the gradual, near-exponential decline of both collapse rate and the intensity of the 180-day-long eruption.\nMagma flow from under the Bárdarbunga volcano drove caldera collapse during the 2014 eruption.\nMagma flow from under the Bárdarbunga volcano drove caldera collapse during the 2014 eruption.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",2,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Gudmundsson","given":"Magnús T."},{"family":"Jónsdóttir","given":"Kristín"},{"family":"Hooper","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Holohan","given":"Eoghan P."},{"family":"Halldórsson","given":"Sæmundur A."},{"family":"Ófeigsson","given":"Benedikt G."},{"family":"Cesca","given":"Simone"},{"family":"Vogfjörd","given":"Kristín S."},{"family":"Sigmundsson","given":"Freysteinn"},{"family":"Högnadóttir","given":"Thórdís"},{"family":"Einarsson","given":"Páll"},{"family":"Sigmarsson","given":"Olgeir"},{"family":"Jarosch","given":"Alexander H."},{"family":"Jónasson","given":"Kristján"},{"family":"Magnússon","given":"Eyjólfur"},{"family":"Hreinsdóttir","given":"Sigrún"},{"family":"Bagnardi","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Parks","given":"Michelle M."},{"family":"Hjörleifsdóttir","given":"Vala"},{"family":"Pálsson","given":"Finnur"},{"family":"Walter","given":"Thomas R."},{"family":"Schöpfer","given":"Martin P.

So far, scientists can only offer empirical evidence from statistical compilations of past sequences, arguing that normally the aftershock sequence will decay gradually whereas the occurrence of a forthcoming larger event has a probability of a few per cent. Here we analyse the average size distribution of aftershocks of the recent Amatrice–Norcia and Kumamoto earthquake sequences, and we suggest that in many cases it may be possible to discriminate whether an ongoing sequence represents a decaying aftershock sequence or foreshocks to an upcoming large event. We propose a simple traffic light classification to assess in real time the level of concern about a subsequent larger event and test it against 58 sequences, achieving a classification accuracy of 95 per cent.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Gulia","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Wiemer","given":"Stefan"}],"citation-key":"Gulia.Wiemer_2019_RealtimeDiscrimination","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-019-1606-4","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7777","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",10]]},"language":"en","license":"2019 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","number":"7777","page":"193-199","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Real-time discrimination of earthquake foreshocks and aftershocks","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1606-4","volume":"574"},
  {"id":"Guo.etal_2018_BaroclinicTides","abstract":"The baroclinic tides in the Red Sea are simulated using a three-dimensional, nonhydrostatic, high-resolution Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model. Various observations have been used to validate the simulation results. A good match between the model results and observations from ﬁve tidal gauges has been obtained. Tidal amplitude and phase data from 21 tidal stations present high correlation coeﬃcients and low deviations with the model results. Comparisons between model and Oregon State University Tidal Inversion Software data suggest consistent results, with only small discrepancies at the locations of the amphidromic points. Tidal currents from four mooring observations are in good agreement with the simulation results, with discrepancies appearing in shallow areas and those with complex bottom topography. Based on the simulation results, the basic characteristics of baroclinic tides in the Red Sea are analyzed. The properties of barotropic tides, and distribution of the forcing function parameter, indicate that the baroclinic tides are generated mainly in four areas: the Bab-el-Mandeb (BAM) Strait, the southern Red Sea, the Gulf of Suez, and the Strait of Tiran. This is conﬁrmed by the spatial distributions of baroclinic tidal kinetic energy and energy ﬂux. The properties of the conversion rate from barotropic tides to baroclinic tides, and the divergence of baroclinic energy ﬂux, further reveal quantitatively that the southern Red Sea features the most of the generated baroclinic energy. The majority of the baroclinic energy disappears within the four areas, either dissipating due to friction and bottom drag or converting back to barotropic energy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Guo","given":"Daquan"},{"family":"Kartadikaria","given":"Aditya"},{"family":"Zhan","given":"Peng"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Jieshuo"},{"family":"Li","given":"Mingjie"},{"family":"Hoteit","given":"Ibrahim"}],"citation-key":"Guo.etal_2018_BaroclinicTides","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans","container-title-short":"J.

We demonstrate that these claims are unjustiﬁed. Stochastic simulations with Poissonian background activity and triggered Omoritype aftershock sequences are shown to reproduce the interevent-time distributions observed on different spatial and magnitude scales in California. Thus the empirical distribution can be explained without any additional long-term clustering. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the shape of the interevent-time distribution, which can be approximated by the gamma distribution, is determined by the percentage of mainshocks in the catalog. This percentage can be calculated by the mean and variance of the interevent times and varies between 5% and 90% for different regions in California. Our investigation of stochastic simulations indicates that the intereventtime distribution provides a nonparametric reconstruction of the mainshock magnitude-frequency distribution that is superior to standard declustering algorithm.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Hainzl","given":"S."}],"citation-key":"Hainzl_2006_EstimatingBackground","container-title":"Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America","container-title-short":"Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America","DOI":"10.1785/0120050053","ISSN":"0037-1106","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"313-320","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Estimating Background Activity Based on Interevent-Time Distribution","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/bssa/article/96/1/313-320/146796","volume":"96"},
  {"id":"Hainzl_2021_ETASApproach","abstract":"The epidemic‐type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model is a powerful statistical model to explain and forecast the spatiotemporal evolution of seismicity. However, its parameter estimation can be strongly biased by catalog deficiencies, particularly short‐term incompleteness related to missing events in phases of high‐seismic activity. Recent studies have shown that these short‐term fluctuations of the completeness magnitude can be explained by the blindness of detection algorithms after earthquakes, preventing the detection of events with a smaller magnitude. Based on this assumption, I derive a direct relation between the true and detectable seismicity rate and magnitude distributions, respectively. These relations only include one additional parameter, the so‐called blind time Tb, and lead to a closed‐form maximum‐likelihood formulation to estimate the ETAS parameters directly accounting for varying completeness. Tests using synthetic simulations show that the true parameters can be resolved from incomplete catalogs. Finally, I apply the new model to California’s most prominent mainshock–aftershock sequences in the last decades. The results show that the model leads to superior fits with Tb decreasing with time, indicating improved detection algorithms. The estimated parameters significantly differ from the estimation with the standard approach, indicating higher b‐values and larger trigger potentials than previously thought.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Hainzl","given":"Sebastian"}],"citation-key":"Hainzl_2021_ETASApproach","container-title":"Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America","container-title-short":"Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America","DOI":"10.1785/0120210146","ISSN":"0037-1106","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,14]]},"source":"Silverchair","title":"ETAS‐Approach Accounting for Short‐Term Incompleteness of Earthquake Catalogs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1785/0120210146"},

Furthermore, the productivity decays systematically with depth in the uppermost 80 km, while the b value increases. We show that this lack of aftershocks and the observed depth dependence can be simply explained by a linear relationship between the productivity and the coupling coefficient, leading to Båth law only in the case of full coupling.

In this study, we analyze the interseismic deformation along these fault systems using 23 years of Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements obtained from 209 campaign and 60 continuous stations. This GPS data set is the longest record and the densest data set for the DSF, the CGFS, and the Levant region. We use this data set to investigate the spatial variations of slip and creep rates along the southern and central sections of the DSF and the CGFS. Our inversion model results indicate that part of the tectonic motion is transferred from the DSF to the CGFS. We find that the left-lateral strike-slip motion along the DSF decreases in a rate of 0.9 ± 0.4 mm/year, from 4.8 ± 0.3 mm/year south to the intersection with the CGFS to 3.9 ± 0.4 mm/year north to this intersection. Along the CGFS, the left-lateral strike-slip motion ranges between ∼0.3 and 0.5 mm/year and the extension rate between ∼0.6 and 0.7 mm/year, indicating a total slip rate vector of 0.8 ± 0.4 mm/year in the DSF direction, in agreement with the reduction of slip rate along the DSF near the intersection with the CGFS. Shallow creep is found along the southern and central sections of the Dead Sea basin and the northern Jordan Valley section of the DSF, with creep rates of 3.4 ± 0.4 and 2.3 ± 0.4 mm/year, respectively.

The majority are silent for decades to centuries, until they suddenly rupture and produce earthquakes. With a focus on shallow continental active-tectonic regions, this paper reviews a subset of faults that have a different behavior. These unusual faults slowly creep for long periods of time and produce many small earthquakes. The presence of fault creep and the related microseismicity helps illuminate faults that might not otherwise be located in ﬁne detail, but there is also the question of how creeping faults contribute to seismic hazard. It appears that well-recorded creeping fault earthquakes of up to magnitude 6.6 that have occurred in shallow continental regions produce similar fault-surface rupture areas and similar peak ground shaking as their locked fault counterparts of the same earthquake magnitude. The behavior of much larger earthquakes on shallow creeping continental faults is less well known, because there is a dearth of comprehensive observations. Computational simulations provide an opportunity to ﬁll the gaps in our understanding, particularly of the dynamic processes that occur during large earthquake rupture and arrest.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Harris","given":"Ruth A."}],"citation-key":"Harris_2017_LargeEarthquakes","container-title":"Reviews of Geophysics","container-title-short":"Rev.

We find that the estimated stress changes are consistent with the triggering of four out of the five aftershocks with magnitude greater than 4.5, and that the largest changes (1–10 bar), occurring on part of the San Bernardino segment of the San Andreas fault, may have decreased the time to the next magnitude 8 earthquake by about 14 years.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Harris","given":"Ruth A."},{"family":"Simpson","given":"Robert W."}],"citation-key":"Harris.Simpson_1992_ChangesStatic","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/360251a0","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"6401","issued":{"date-parts":[["1992",11]]},"language":"en","license":"1992 Nature Publishing Group","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research","number":"6401","page":"251-254","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Changes in static stress on southern California faults after the 1992 Landers earthquake","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/360251a0","volume":"360"},

  {"id":"Heimisson_2019_ConstitutiveLaw","abstract":"The constitutive relationship of Dieterich (1994, https://doi.org/10.1029/93JB02581) for earthquake production has been applied widely to earthquake triggering. The Dieterich theory achieves mathematical simplicity and thus lends itself to practical applications through a number of simplifying assumptions. Perhaps the most suspect and criticized assumption is that seismic sources do not interact. Here I provide an extension of the constitutive framework, using the modified formulation of Heimisson and Segall (2018, https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JB015656) which accounts for source interactions. Moreover, I explore ways to account for earthquake magnitudes and highlight potential directions for future research. I identify conditions under which the constitutive relationship with interactions reduces to the noninteracting Dieterich theory, revealing that an interacting population may be modeled as an equivalent noninteracting population. This result may partly explain the success of the Dieterich theory in spite of assuming no interactions. These special conditions reveal that if the magnitude distribution (e.g., the b value) is altered by a stress perturbation, then the Dieterich model may either underpredict or overpredict the seismicity rate. Furthermore, the interaction model grants insight into the physical interpretation of the background seismicity rate, which is frequently considered to be a declustered rate. However, the results suggest that interactions do not change the total cumulative number of events over a long time span (t ≫ ta). Finally, I apply the interaction theory to fault slip models, aftershock diffusion, and secondary triggering as illustrative examples.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Heimisson","given":"Elías R."}],"citation-key":"Heimisson_2019_ConstitutiveLaw","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","container-title-short":"J.

On the other hand, movements are highly episodic at plate boundaries. We study the plate dynamics that relate to these two different modes by modelling the displacements observed using the global positioning system in Northeast Iceland 1987–1990. These observations were made about 10 years after an episodic divergent movement between the North American and Eurasian plates 1975–1981. The horizontal displacement field fits well a two-dimensional model of postrupture stress relaxation assuming a thin elastic layer overlying a layer of Newtonian viscosity. This analysis indicates values of about 10 m2/s for the stress diffusivity and 0.3–2 × 1018 Pa s for the Newtonian viscosity of the lower layer. However, no significant correlation exists between the observed and modeled vertical displacements probably because of the relative inaccuracy of the vertical component observations. Assuming that contemporary plate motion is the sum of many displacements that have diffused from boundaries where episodic displacements occur periodically, we simulate the spatial transition from episodic to continuous plate movements. The plate “boundary zone” where movements are episodic or quasi-episodic is of the order of 100 km wide, depending on the stress diffusivity (which may be fairly uniform throughout the world) and the frequency of episodic movements.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Heki","given":"Kosuke"},{"family":"Foulger","given":"G.

We use three-dimensional mechanical models to assess if unaccounted permanent strain surrounding faults could contribute to slip rate discrepancies across disconnected faults within the Mojave Desert (California, USA) portion of the eastern California shear zone (ECSZ). We modified fault configurations derived from the Southern California Earthquake Center Community Fault Model to better represent the disconnected nature of active faults in the ECSZ south of the Garlock fault. The models with revised fault geometry produce slip rates that better match geologic strike-slip rates, thus validating the revisions. Within these models, off-fault deformation accounts for 40% ± 23% of the total strain across the ECSZ. This suggests that a significant portion of the discrepancy between the geologic and geodetically modeled slip rates in the ECSZ could be due to the geodetic inversion model assumption of zero permanent off-fault deformation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Herbert","given":"Justin W."},{"family":"Cooke","given":"Michele L."},{"family":"Oskin","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Difo","given":"Ohilda"}],"citation-key":"Herbert.etal_2014_HowMuch","container-title":"Geology","container-title-short":"Geology","DOI":"10.1130/G34738.1","ISSN":"0091-7613","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",1,1]]},"page":"71-75","source":"Silverchair","title":"How much can off-fault deformation contribute to the slip rate discrepancy within the eastern California shear zone?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1130/G34738.1","volume":"42"},
  {"id":"Hersbach.etal_2020_ERA5Global","abstract":"Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67% to 77%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Hersbach","given":"Hans"},{"family":"Bell","given":"Bill"},{"family":"Berrisford","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Hirahara","given":"Shoji"},{"family":"Horányi","given":"András"},{"family":"Muñoz-Sabater","given":"Joaquín"},{"family":"Nicolas","given":"Julien"},{"family":"Peubey","given":"Carole"},{"family":"Radu","given":"Raluca"},{"family":"Schepers","given":"Dinand"},{"family":"Simmons","given":"Adrian"},{"family":"Soci","given":"Cornel"},{"family":"Abdalla","given":"Saleh"},{"family":"Abellan","given":"Xavier"},{"family":"Balsamo","given":"Gianpaolo"},{"family":"Bechtold","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Biavati","given":"Gionata"},{"family":"Bidlot","given":"Jean"},{"family":"Bonavita","given":"Massimo"},{"family":"De Chiara","given":"Giovanna"},{"family":"Dahlgren","given":"Per"},{"family":"Dee","given":"Dick"},{"family":"Diamantakis","given":"Michail"},{"family":"Dragani","given":"Rossana"},{"family":"Flemming","given":"Johannes"},{"family":"Forbes","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Fuentes","given":"Manuel"},{"family":"Geer","given":"Alan"},{"family":"Haimberger","given":"Leo"},{"family":"Healy","given":"Sean"},{"family":"Hogan","given":"Robin J."},{"family":"Hólm","given":"Elías"},{"family":"Janisková","given":"Marta"},{"family":"Keeley","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Laloyaux","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Lopez","given":"Philippe"},{"family":"Lupu","given":"Cristina"},{"family":"Radnoti","given":"Gabor"},{"family":"Rosnay","given":"Patricia","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Rozum","given":"Iryna"},{"family":"Vamborg","given":"Freja"},{"family":"Villaume","given":"Sebastien"},{"family":"Thépaut","given":"Jean-Noël"}],"citation-key":"Hersbach.etal_2020_ERA5Global","container-title":"Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society","DOI":"10.1002/qj.3803","ISSN":"1477-870X","issue":"730","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC:08419","page":"1999-2049","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The ERA5 global reanalysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/qj.3803","volume":"146"},

We consider the behaviour of models with linear viscous, non-linear viscous, rate-dependent friction, and rate- and state-dependent friction fault rheologies. Both the transient post-seismic creep and the pattern of steady interseismic creep rates surrounding asperities depend on recent coseismic slip and fault rheologies. In these models, post-seismic fault creep is manifest as pulses of elevated creep rates that propagate from the coseismic slip, these pulses feature sharper fronts and are longer lived in models with rate-state friction compared to other models. With small characteristic slip distances in rate-state friction models, interseismic creep is similar to that in models with rate-dependent friction faults, except for the earliest periods of post-seismic creep. Our model can be used to constrain fault rheologies from geodetic observations in cases where the coseismic slip history is relatively well known. When only considering surface deformation over a short period of time, there are strong trade-offs between fault rheology and the details of the imposed coseismic slip. Geodetic observations over longer times following an earthquake will reduce these trade-offs, while simultaneous modelling of interseismic and post-seismic observations provide the strongest constraints on fault rheologies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Hetland","given":"E.

We extend a general linear viscoelastic theory we have previously proposed to models with two layers over a half-space, although we only consider univiscous Maxwell and biviscous Burgers rheologies. In layered viscoelastic models, there are multiple mechanical timescales of post-seismic deformation; however, not all of these timescales arise as distinct phases of post-seismic relaxation observed at the surface. The surface displacements in layered models with only univiscous, Maxwell viscoelastic rheologies always exhibit one exponential-like phase of relaxation. Layered models containing biviscous rheologies may produce multiple phases of relaxation, where the distinctness of the phases depends on the geometry and the contrast in strengths between the layers. Post-seismic displacements in models with biviscous rheologies can often be described by logarithmic functions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Hetland","given":"E.

  {"id":"Hetland.Simons_2010_PostseismicInterseismic","abstract":"We use idealized subduction megathrust models to examine aseismic, frictional fault creep throughout the interseismic period. We consider rate-dependent and rate- and state-dependent friction. When there is significant post-seismic creep surrounding locations of coseismic slip, the creep rates surrounding an asperity may be lower than the plate convergence rate late in the seismic cycle. This lowering of the creep rates is due to stress shadows forming around the interseismically locked asperities. The size of the stress shadows increases as there is more transient post-seismic creep. Larger asperities produce larger interseismic stress shadows, and multiple asperities can act together to produce a stress shadow larger than the sum of the effects of the individual asperities. For rate-state frictional megathrusts, there is a wide range of transient post-seismic creep that occurs: from pulses of post-seismic creep with decreasing creep rates through time, to delayed post-seismic creep. Delayed post-seismic creep may occur well into the interseismic period, with transient creep lasting over a significant portion of the seismic cycle. Delayed post-seismic creep is generally favoured in velocity strengthening regions with either a larger magnitude of the frictional direct effect or a larger effective normal stress. In addition, regions of the fault undergoing delayed post-seismic creep must be above steady state following coseismic slip.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Hetland","given":"E.

The seismicity pattern reveals significant activity often confined to known surface traces of active faults or within local grabens. Most of the aftershock activity is concentrated north of the main shock in the Aragonese and Eilat basins, while the activity is diffused south of the main shock in the Dakar and Tiran basins. Most of the moderate to strong aftershocks of the whole aftershock sequence occurred in the Aragonese basin, mainly in the first 100 days following the main shock. The Eilat basin is characterized by a larger number of aftershocks composed mainly of smallmagnitude implying a slower decay rate. Assuming a detection level of ML = 3.2 we obtain b-values of 1.01, 1.15, and 0.89 for the whole Gulf of Aqaba, and Eilat and Aragonese basins, respectively, in good agreement with recent studies of the Dead Sea fault.

  {"id":"Hofstetter.etal_2012_CrustalStructure","abstract":"New findings of the velocity structure of the crust across the Dead Sea Basin are obtained by applying tomography-based method to local earthquakes. We use P-wave traveltime of 614 earthquakes that occurred in the Dead Sea Basin in 1983-2009. At all depths, the Dead Sea Basin is characterized by lower velocities relative to both the eastern and western sides of the basin. There is significant seismic activity at a depth of about 20 km, mainly in the centre and the northern part of the basin.At shallow depths (&lt;15 km) there is more seismic activity on the eastern side of the basin than on the western side, and the northern basin is generally more active than the southern basin. Asymmetry is also observed in the faults that border the Dead Sea Basin. The Arava Fault on the eastern side, with nearly vertical dip faulting, appears to be a clear boundary at all depths down to about 20 km. The depth extension of the Jericho Fault on the western side of the basin is definitely limited to less than 15 km. At greater depths of 20 km or more, the western side is only partially bounded by a fault. The concentration of earthquakes in the central part of the basin at depths larger than 15 km suggests that the Dead Sea Fault at those depths acts as one single fault that is located in, or near, the central axis of the basin.The existence of a number of clusters of earthquakes that spread from shallow depths of a few kilometres up to a depth of about 22 km, points to several defined faults that traverse the Dead Sea Basin. One such example is the aftershock sequence of the 2004 earthquake that occurred in the northern Dead Sea Basin. Seismic activity near Mt Sodom is relatively low and occurs at shallow depths down to 10 km, whereas at larger depths (≥ 15 km) it ceases. This implies that the whole structure is relatively shallow with no wide and deeper extension. Seismic activity near and within the Lisan Peninsula extends to somewhat larger depths (~15 km), and then it ceases.The occurrence of earthquakes at large depths suggests that the upper and the lower crust are relatively cool, as was also suggested by earlier studies, pointing to the fact that the heat flow is significantly below the global average value.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Hofstetter","given":"R."},{"family":"Dorbath","given":"C."},{"family":"Calò","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"Hofstetter.etal_2012_CrustalStructure","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","container-title-short":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2012.05369.x","ISSN":"0956-540X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",4,1]]},"note":"ZSCC:00036","page":"554-568","source":"Silverchair","title":"Crustal structure of the Dead Sea Basin from local earthquake tomography","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2012.05369.x","volume":"189"},

Our method also uses the spatial correlation of the phases rather than a well-defined phase history so that we can observe temporally-variable processes, e.g., volcanic deformation. The algorithm involves removing the residual topographic component of flattened interferogram phase for each PS, then unwrapping the PS phases both spatially and temporally. Our method finds scatterers with stable phase characteristics independent of amplitudes associated with man-made objects, and is applicable to areas where conventional InSAR fails due to complete decorrelation of the majority of scatterers, yet a few stable scatterers are present.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Hooper","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Zebker","given":"Howard"},{"family":"Segall","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Kampes","given":"Bert"}],"citation-key":"Hooper.etal_2004_NewMethod","container-title":"Geophysical Research Letters","DOI":"10.1029/2004GL021737","ISSN":"1944-8007","issue":"23","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"A new method for measuring deformation on volcanoes and other natural terrains using InSAR persistent scatterers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2004GL021737","volume":"31"},

  {"id":"Hoyt.etal_2020_WidespreadSubsidence","abstract":"Over the last three decades, most of the 25 million hectares of tropical peatlands in Southeast Asia have been deforested and drained. As a consequence, declining water tables are exposing peat to oxidation, converting plant material accumulated over millennia to carbon dioxide, and causing land subsidence. Here, we quantify the widespread peat carbon loss by using InSAR remote sensing to map subsidence at 90-m resolution across 2.7 Mha of peatland area from 2007 to 2011. Over 90% of the surveyed area is subsiding, with a mean rate of 2.2 cm yr−1. Consequently, the region now faces loss of productive land and flooding because many peatlands are near sea level. Our measurements reveal that smallholder agricultural areas and degraded peatlands are subsiding at rates comparable to those of plantations, and that subsidence rates increase away from rivers and decrease over time following drainage. Because of its detailed spatial resolution, InSAR provides a valuable tool to identify emissions by land use and geography and to target hotspots for better management. Finally, we use remotely sensed maps to update IPCC emissions factors and calculate regional CO2 emissions from peat oxidation of 155 ± 30 MtC yr−1 in 2015, similar in magnitude to both regional fossil-fuel emissions and peat fires.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Hoyt","given":"Alison M."},{"family":"Chaussard","given":"Estelle"},{"family":"Seppalainen","given":"Sandra S."},{"family":"Harvey","given":"Charles F."}],"citation-key":"Hoyt.etal_2020_WidespreadSubsidence","container-title":"Nature Geoscience","container-title-short":"Nat.

  {"id":"Hsu.etal_2003_TwodimensionalDislocation","abstract":"We use a Global Positioning System (GPS)-derived surface velocity field of Taiwan for the time period between 1993 and 1999 to infer interseismic slip rates on subsurface faults. We adopt a composite elastic half-space dislocation model constrained by the observed horizontal velocities projected into the direction of plate motion (306‡). The GPS data are divided into northern and southern regions and the velocities in each region are projected into single profiles. The model fault geometry includes a shallowly dipping de¤collement, based on the balanced geological cross-sections in the Coastal Plain and Western Foothills, and a two-segment fault representing the Longitudinal Valley Fault (LVF) in eastern Taiwan. The de¤collement is composed of two fault segments, one extending west under the Central Range (CR) and one extending east of the LVF, with estimated slip rates of about 35 and 80 mm/yr, respectively. The optimal geometry of de¤collement is subhorizontal (2‡V11‡) at a depth of 8V9 km. The inferred surface location of the western end point of dislocation in the northern profile is located 15 km east of the Chelungpu Fault, while in the southern section, it is located beneath the Chukou Fault. The elastic dislocation model successfully matches the horizontal velocity data, and predicts elastic strain accumulation in the Western Foothills that will presumably be released in future earthquakes. However, considered over multiple earthquake cycles, our model cannot explain the topography of the CR and thus fails to predict the active mountain building process in Taiwan. This failure indicates that both horizontal and vertical velocity fields require a more complex rheological model that incorporates inelastic behavior.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Hsu","given":"Ya-Ju"},{"family":"Simons","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Shui-Beih"},{"family":"Kuo","given":"Long-Chen"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Horng-Yue"}],"citation-key":"Hsu.etal_2003_TwodimensionalDislocation","container-title":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","container-title-short":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","DOI":"10.1016/S0012-821X(03)00203-6","ISSN":"0012821X","issue":"3-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",6]]},"language":"en","page":"287-294","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A two-dimensional dislocation model for interseismic deformation of the Taiwan mountain belt","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0012821X03002036","volume":"211"},

We estimate strain rates with a new but simple approach that solves for surface velocity on a rectangular grid while accounting for the distance between observations and each grid node and the impact of a spatially variable density of observations. This approach provides stable and interpretable strain-rate estimates. In addition, we perform a stress tensor inversion using earthquake focal mechanisms determined by P waves ﬁrst-motion polarities. Our estimates of the principal orientations of two-dimensional surface strain rate tensor generally agree with the inferred orientations of the stress axes. This agreement suggests that a large scale variation of stress orientations from the surface to the base of the crust is insigniﬁcant and the predicted faulting style is consistent with stress buildup during the interseismic loading. We ﬁnd that the geometric conﬁguration of the Chinese continental margin alone cannot fully explain the distribution of maximum contraction and compressive axes in Taiwan. Distribution of seismicity and focal mechanisms before and after the Chi-Chi mainshock suggest that the maximum principal stress axis is vertically-oriented in the Central Range; in contrast to the horizontal maximum principal stress axis in western Taiwan and the Longitudinal Valley. Extension in the Central Range reﬂects the consequence of exhumation and crustal thickening.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Hsu","given":"Ya-Ju"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Shui-Beih"},{"family":"Simons","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Kuo","given":"Long-Chen"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Horng-Yue"}],"citation-key":"Hsu.etal_2009_InterseismicCrustal","container-title":"Tectonophysics","container-title-short":"Tectonophysics","DOI":"10.1016/j.tecto.2008.11.016","ISSN":"00401951","issue":"1-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",12]]},"language":"en","page":"4-18","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Interseismic crustal deformation in the Taiwan plate boundary zone revealed by GPS observations, seismicity, and earthquake focal mechanisms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0040195108005775","volume":"479"},

In recent years, great efforts have been made to resolve complete three-dimensional (3-D) displacements from InSAR measurements. This contribution is intended to provide a systematic review of the progress achieved in this field. Based on an analysis of the InSAR LOS measurements, we first cover two commonly used techniques, i.e., Offset-Tracking and multi-aperture InSAR (MAI), with which the surface displacement in the azimuth direction can be measured together with the LOS displacement. Several methods for mapping 3-D displacements using InSAR measurements are subsequently presented and categorized into three groups: (i) combination of multi-pass LOS and azimuth measurements; (ii) integration of InSAR and GPS data; and (iii) prior information assisted approaches. The strengths and weaknesses of each method are analyzed to show the applicability of each method to specific 3-D displacement mapping cases, in hope to provide a useful guidance in choosing a suitable approach accordingly. Finally, suggestions for resolving the challenging issues and outlook of future research are given.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Hu","given":"J."},{"family":"Li","given":"Z.

This paper presents a fast InSAR time-series processing approach targeting Sentinel-1 TOPS images to process massive data with higher efficiency and resolution. We employed a GPU-assisted InSAR processing method to accelerate data processing. Statistically homogeneous pixel selection (SHPS) filtering was used to reduce noise and detect features in scenes with minimal image resolution loss. Compared to the commonly used InSAR processing software, the proposed method significantly improved the Sentinel-1 TOPS data processing efficiency. The feasibility of the method was investigated by mapping the surface deformation over the Yellow River Delta using SAR datasets acquired between January 2021 and February 2022. The findings indicate that several events of significant subsidence have occurred in the study area.

Beyond the previously known tremor zone beneath the southern Central Range, where newly detected tremors align along a low-angle thrust plane, we identified several new tremor “hotspots” spanning 200 km along the mountain belt. These hotspots are situated at the termination of the subducting slabs and around the deep (25–50 km) extension of the Central Range fault, where repeating earthquakes occur at a depth of 10–25 km.

Res. 99 10143–62) as a novel method for data assimilation: state estimation for noisily observed time-dependent problems. Since that time it has had enormous impact in many application domains because of its robustness and ease of implementation, and numerical evidence of its accuracy. In this paper we propose the application of an iterative ensemble Kalman method for the solution of a wide class of inverse problems. In this context we show that the estimate of the unknown function that we obtain with the ensemble Kalman method lies in a subspace spanned by the initial ensemble. Hence the resulting error may be bounded above by the error found from the best approximation in this subspace. We provide numerical experiments which compare the error incurred by the ensemble Kalman method for inverse problems with the error of the best approximation in , and with variants on traditional least-squares approaches, restricted to the subspace . In so doing we demonstrate that the ensemble Kalman method for inverse problems provides a derivative-free optimization method with comparable accuracy to that achieved by traditional least-squares approaches. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the accuracy is of the same order of magnitude as that achieved by the best approximation. Three examples are used to demonstrate these assertions: inversion of a compact linear operator; inversion of piezometric head to determine hydraulic conductivity in a Darcy model of groundwater flow; and inversion of Eulerian velocity measurements at positive times to determine the initial condition in an incompressible fluid.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Iglesias","given":"Marco A."},{"family":"Law","given":"Kody J.

The second had a duration exceeding 1 month and was observed in February 2011, just before the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake; the moment magnitude of this event reached 7.0. The two events preceded interplate earthquakes of magnitudes M6.1 (December 2008) and M7.3 (March 9, 2011), respectively; the latter is the largest foreshock of the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake. Our ﬁndings indicate that these slow slip events induced increases in shear stress, which in turn triggered the interplate earthquakes. The slow slip event source area on the fault is also located within the downdip portion of the huge-coseismic-slip area of the 2011 earthquake. This demonstrates episodic slow slip and seismic behavior occurring on the same portions of the megathrust fault, suggesting that the faults undergo slip in slow slip events can also rupture seismically.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Ito","given":"Yoshihiro"},{"family":"Hino","given":"Ryota"},{"family":"Kido","given":"Motoyuki"},{"family":"Fujimoto","given":"Hiromi"},{"family":"Osada","given":"Yukihito"},{"family":"Inazu","given":"Daisuke"},{"family":"Ohta","given":"Yusaku"},{"family":"Iinuma","given":"Takeshi"},{"family":"Ohzono","given":"Mako"},{"family":"Miura","given":"Satoshi"},{"family":"Mishina","given":"Masaaki"},{"family":"Suzuki","given":"Kensuke"},{"family":"Tsuji","given":"Takeshi"},{"family":"Ashi","given":"Juichiro"}],"citation-key":"Ito.etal_2013_EpisodicSlow","container-title":"Tectonophysics","container-title-short":"Tectonophysics","DOI":"10.1016/j.tecto.2012.08.022","ISSN":"00401951","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",7]]},"language":"en","page":"14-26","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Episodic slow slip events in the Japan subduction zone before the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0040195112004994","volume":"600"},
  {"id":"Ito.Kaneko_2023_PhysicalMechanism","abstract":"Observations of seismicity prior to large earthquakes show that the slope of a Gutenberg-Richter magnitude-frequency relation, referred to as a b-value, sometimes decreases with time to the mainshock. Yet, underlying physical processes associated with the temporal change of a b-value remain unclear. Here we utilize continuum models of fully dynamic earthquake cycles with fault frictional heterogeneities and aim to simulate the temporal variation of a b-value. We first identify a parameter regime in which the model gives rise to an active and accelerating foreshock behavior prior to the mainshock. We then focus on the spatio-temporal pattern of the simulated foreshocks and analyze their statistics. We find that the b-value of simulated foreshocks decreases with time prior to the mainshock. A marked decrease in the resulting b-value occurs over the duration of less than a few percent of the mainshock recurrence interval, broadly consistent with foreshock behaviors and b-value changes as observed in nature and laboratory, rock-friction experiments. In this model, increased shear stresses on creeping (or velocity-strengthening) fault patches resulting from numerous foreshocks make these creeping patches more susceptible to future coseismic slip, increasing the likelihood of large ruptures and leading to a smaller b-value with time. This mechanism differs from a widely invoked idea that the decrease of a b-value is caused by a rapid increase in shear stress that promotes micro-crack growth, and offers a new interpretation of b-value changes prior to a large earthquake.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Ito","given":"Ryo"},{"family":"Kaneko","given":"Yoshihiro"}],"citation-key":"Ito.Kaneko_2023_PhysicalMechanism","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/2023JB027413","ISSN":"2169-9356","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","page":"e2023JB027413","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Physical Mechanism for a Temporal Decrease of the Gutenberg-Richter b-Value Prior to a Large Earthquake","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2023JB027413","volume":"128"},

Wegener's concept of continental drift was the first successful globally unifying view, but it was discarded by most Earth scientists. The “real” change of paradigms did not come before mid-century through geophysical observations in paleomagnetism, seismology, bathymetry, seafloor geology and dating, leading to the “New Global Tectonics” of seafloor spreading and plate tectonics. Although real-time plate kinematics is now firmly established through direct geodetic observations from radio-astronomy and with the aid of artificial satellites, knowledge is incomplete and must be continually “updated”. Quite a number of problems are not yet solved. These may, some day, lead to another change of paradigms, but certainly not back to “fixism”. Problems are related to scale, frame of reference, and especially dynamics. However, plate tectonics is presently the most successful theory in the history of geology.

Three large earthquakes (Mw 7.3, 5.9 and 6.3) struck in the Lurestan arc of the Zagros SFB in 2017 and 2018. The sequence was recorded by seismic stations at regional, and teleseismic distances. Coseismic surface displacements, measured by Sentinel-1A/B satellites, provide additional data and a unique opportunity to study these earthquakes in detail. Here, we complement previous studies of the coseismic slip distribution of the 12 November 2017 Mw 7.3 Ezgeleh earthquake by a detailed analysis of its aftershocks, and we analysed the rupture process of the two interrelated earthquakes (25 August 2018 Mw 5.9 Tazehabad and the 25 November 2018 Mw 6.3 Sarpol-e Zahab earthquakes). We model the surface displacements obtained from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) measurements and seismic records. We conduct non-linear probabilistic optimizations based on joint InSAR and seismic data to obtain finite-fault rupture of these earthquakes. The Lurestan arc earthquakes were followed by a sustained aftershock activity, with 133 aftershocks exceeding Mn 4.0 until 30 December 2019. We rely on the permanent seismic networks of Iran and Iraq to relocate ∼700 Mn 3 + events and estimate moment tensor solutions for 85 aftershocks down to Mw 4.0. The 2017 Ezgeleh earthquake has been considered to activate a low-angle (∼17°) dextral-thrust fault at the depth of 10–20 km. However, most of its aftershocks have shallow centroid depths (8–12 km). The joint interpretation of finite source models, moment tensor and hypocentral location indicate that the 2018 Tazehabad and Sarpol-e Zahab earthquakes ruptured different strike-slip structures, providing evidence for the activation of the sinistral and dextral strike-slip faults, respectively.

Application to the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake sequence reveals the coseismic displacements from the far field to the near field.

One would expect small earthquakes to occur at least at the bottom of the seismogenic zone, where deeper aseismic deformation concentrates loading. We suggest that the absence of such concentrated microseismicity indicates deep rupture past the seismogenic zone in previous large earthquakes. We support this conclusion with numerical simulations of fault behavior and observations of recent major events. Our modeling implies that the 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake on the San Andreas Fault in Southern California penetrated below the seismogenic zone by at least 3 to 5 kilometers.

  {"id":"Jiang.Lohman_2021_CoherenceguidedInSAR","abstract":"While the quality and availability of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data has dramatically improved in recent years, InSAR analysis and interpretation remain challenging in actively deforming regions with extensive agricultural activities, where vegetation changes and soil moisture variability can degrade data quality or introduce confounding signals. Here we use Sentinel-1 satellite imagery for the Imperial Valley, California, over the period of 2015–2019 to explore how factors specific to land surface changes may impact InSAR time series and to resolve time-varying deformation due to tectonic processes and geothermal energy production. We examine the temporal variability of data quality, via interferometric phase coherence, at high spatial resolution, taking into account the observation that some agricultural fields lie fallow for long time in­ tervals punctuated by periods of cultivation. This strategy allows us to better distinguish signals and noise associated with agricultural activities, shoreline changes, or surface soil conditions. A series of masking, inter­ polation, and filtering steps facilitate phase unwrapping, and the unwrapped, unfiltered product is then recov­ ered, reducing artifacts from spatial filtering. We adopt model-based tropospheric corrections to improve time series results, particularly in regions with high topographic relief, along with the use of distributed reference points to render a more uniform error structure. We validate InSAR observations with continuous GPS where available and find that the estimates of average line-of-sight (LOS) velocity over the valley from InSAR and GPS agree to ~3 mm/yr in areas with good data coverage. Discrepancies between the two estimates often exist in areas with lower InSAR data quality; in better-constrained areas, they appear to reveal signals attributable to surficial processes occurring in the uppermost soil layers. We observe a diverse suite of natural signals over multiple spatial scales, including steady interseismic deformation, seasonal lake-level-modulated signals at the southeastern Salton Sea shore, and transient slow slip on the Superstition Hills fault. In addition, we observe complex deformation at four geothermal fields within the valley. Extensive subsidence at the Salton Sea geothermal field suggests spatial overlap of anthropogenic and tectonic deformation, interspersed with potential surficial signals. Geothermal sites at East Mesa, North Brawley, and Heber exhibit smaller-amplitude, more localized deformation, often with nonlinear temporal trends. Our analysis demonstrates the need to assess whether InSAR signals result from surficial changes or deeper sources, and produces robust ground deformation data in support of efforts to study subsurface processes, manage geothermal operations, and improve hazard assessments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Jiang","given":"Junle"},{"family":"Lohman","given":"Rowena B."}],"citation-key":"Jiang.Lohman_2021_CoherenceguidedInSAR","container-title":"Remote Sensing of Environment","container-title-short":"Remote Sensing of Environment","DOI":"10.1016/j.rse.2020.112160","ISSN":"00344257","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC:00014","page":"112160","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Coherence-guided InSAR deformation analysis in the presence of ongoing land surface changes in the Imperial Valley, California","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0034425720305332","volume":"253"},
  {"id":"Jiang.Simons_2016_ProbabilisticImaging","abstract":"Diverse observations from the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake pointed to large coseismic fault slip proximal to the Japan Trench. This seismic failure prompted a reevaluation of the conventional view that the outer forearc is generally aseismic. However, the nature of near-trench fault slip during this event remains debated, without consensus on whether slip peaked at the trench or at greater depths. Here we develop a probabilistic approach to image the spatiotemporal evolution of coseismic seaﬂoor displacement from near-ﬁeld tsunami observations. In a Bayesian framework, we sample ensembles of nonlinear source models parameterized to focus on near-trench features, incorporating the uncertainty in modeling dispersive tsunami waves in addition to nominal observational errors. Our models indicate that seaﬂoor in the region of the earthquake was broadly uplifted and tilted seaward approaching the deep-ocean trench. Over length scales of ~40 km, seaﬂoor uplift peaks at 5 Æ 0.6 m near the inner-outer forearc transition and decreases to 2 m at the trench axis over a distance of 50 km, corresponding to a seaﬂoor tilt of 0.06 Æ 0.02 m/km. Over length scales of ~20 km, peak uplift reaches 7 Æ 2 m at the similar location, but uplift at the trench is less constrained. Elastic modeling that reproduces the observed tilt requires a coseismic slip deﬁcit at the trench. Such a deﬁcit is effectively consistent with a metastable frictional model for the shallowest megathrust. While large shallow earthquakes in the region cannot be completely ruled out, aseismic deformation is the most likely mode for satisfying the long-term slip budget.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Jiang","given":"Junle"},{"family":"Simons","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"Jiang.Simons_2016_ProbabilisticImaging","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","container-title-short":"J.

We use a physical model to estimate the spatial distribution of locked, stress‒accumulating areas of the fault constrained by surface creep rate measurements and GPS‒derived velocities.

Interseismic elastic distortion of the blocks is modeled due to periodic locking and unlocking of faults throughout the earthquake cycle. Patches on the fault are assumed to be either locked during the interseismic period or creeping at constant shear stress. We utilize a Bayesian, probabilistic inversion method to infer the posterior probability distribution of long-term interseismic fault slip rates, distribution of locked and creeping patches, and relative weighting of multiple data sets. We illustrate the method with an inversion of a synthetic data set. We apply the method to estimate fault slip rates and the distribution of interseismic creep on faults in the San Francisco Bay Area, CA, using GPS-derived velocities and geologic measurements of fault slip rates. We show that the inferred fault slip rates and areas of the locked regions of faults are sensitive to the assumed viscosity of the upper mantle and the timing of past earthquakes and can be significantly different from values inferred from elastic models that do not include viscous flow.

Here we describe a method to correct interferograms from the effects of the spatial and temporal variations in tropospheric stratification by computing tropospheric delay maps coincident with SAR acquisitions using the ERA-Interim global meteorological model. The modeled phase delay is integrated along vertical profiles at the ERA-I grid nodes and interpolated at the spatial sampling of the interferograms above the elevation of each image pixel.

This paucity of earthquakes is often attributed to partitioning of deformation across multiple structures as well as aseismic deformation within and at the base of the prism (Davis et al., 1983). We use teleseismic data and satellite optical and radar imaging of the 2013 Mw 7.7 earthquake that occurred on the southeastern edge of the Makran plate boundary zone to study this unexpected earthquake. We first compute a multiple point‐source solution from W‐phase waveforms to estimate fault geometry and rupture duration and timing. We then derive the distribution of subsurface fault slip from geodetic coseismic offsets. We sample for the slip posterior probability density function using a Bayesian approach, including a full description of the data covariance and accounting for errors in the elastic structure of the crust. The rupture nucleated on a subvertical segment, branching out of the Chaman fault system, and grew into a major earthquake along a 50° north‐dipping thrust fault with significant along‐strike curvature. Fault slip propagated at an average speed of 3.0 km/s for about 180 km and is concentrated in the top 10 km with no displacement on the underlying décollement. This earthquake does not exhibit significant slip deficit near the surface, nor is there significant segmentation of the rupture. We propose that complex interaction between the subduction accommodating the Arabia-Eurasia convergence to the south and the Ornach Nal fault plate boundary between India and Eurasia resulted in the significant strain gradient observed prior to this earthquake.

  {"id":"Jolivet.etal_2014_ImprovingInSAR","abstract":"Spatial and temporal variations of pressure, temperature, and water vapor content in the atmosphere introduce signiﬁcant confounding delays in interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations of ground deformation and bias estimates of regional strain rates. Producing robust estimates of tropospheric delays remains one of the key challenges in increasing the accuracy of ground deformation measurements using InSAR. Recent studies revealed the eﬃciency of global atmospheric reanalysis to mitigate the impact of tropospheric delays, motivating further exploration of their potential. Here we explore the eﬀectiveness of these models in several geographic and tectonic settings on both single interferograms and time series analysis products. Both hydrostatic and wet contributions to the phase delay are important to account for. We validate these path delay corrections by comparing with estimates of vertically integrated atmospheric water vapor content derived from the passive multispectral imager Medium-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer, onboard the Envisat satellite. Generally, the performance of the prediction depends on the vigor of atmospheric turbulence. We discuss (1) how separating atmospheric and orbital contributions allows one to better measure long-wavelength deformation and (2) how atmospheric delays aﬀect measurements of surface deformation following earthquakes, and (3) how such a method allows us to reduce biases in multiyear strain rate estimates by reducing the inﬂuence of unevenly sampled seasonal oscillations of the tropospheric delay.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Jolivet","given":"Romain"},{"family":"Agram","given":"Piyush Shanker"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Nina Y."},{"family":"Simons","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Doin","given":"Marie‐Pierre"},{"family":"Peltzer","given":"Gilles"},{"family":"Li","given":"Zhenhong"}],"citation-key":"Jolivet.etal_2014_ImprovingInSAR","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"Jolivet.etal_2023_DailyCentennial","abstract":"Slow, aseismic slip plays a crucial role in the initiation, propagation, and arrest of large earthquakes along active faults. In addition, aseismic slip controls the budget of elastic strain in the crust, hence the amount of energy available for upcoming earthquakes. The conditions for slow slip include specific material properties of the fault zone, pore fluid pressure, and geometrical complexities of the fault plane. Fine scale descriptions of aseismic slip at the surface and at depth are key to determine the factors controlling the occurrence of slow, aseismic versus rapid, seismic fault slip. We focus on the spatial and temporal distribution of aseismic slip along the North Anatolian Fault, the plate boundary accommodating the 2 cm/yr of relative motion between Anatolia and Eurasia. Along the eastern termination of the rupture trace of the 1944 M7.3 Bolu-Gerede earthquake lies a segment that slips aseismically since at least the 1950s. We use Sentinel 1 time series of displacement and GNSS data to provide a spatio-temporal description of the kinematics of fault slip. We show that aseismic slip observed at the surface is coincident with a shallow locking depth and that slow slip events with a return period of 2.5 years are restricted to a specific section of the fault. In the light of historical measurements, we discuss potential rheological implications of our results and propose a simple alternative model to explain the local occurrence of shallow aseismic slip at this location.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Jolivet","given":"R."},{"family":"Jara","given":"J."},{"family":"Dalaison","given":"M."},{"family":"Rouet-Leduc","given":"B."},{"family":"Özdemir","given":"A."},{"family":"Dogan","given":"U."},{"family":"Çakir","given":"Z."},{"family":"Ergintav","given":"S."},{"family":"Dubernet","given":"P."}],"citation-key":"Jolivet.etal_2023_DailyCentennial","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/2022JB026018","ISSN":"2169-9356","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2023 The Authors.","page":"e2022JB026018","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Daily to Centennial Behavior of Aseismic Slip Along the Central Section of the North Anatolian Fault","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2022JB026018","volume":"128"},

Locations are subject to uncertainties, which will not be the same for every earthquake. The data should therefore not be interpreted simply by inspection, which is difficult in the case of three?dimensional data anyway. Instead, we propose using the location uncertainties as a guide in processing the data. Earthquake locations are moved inside their uncertainty or confidence ellipsoids until a simplified picture of the earthquake cloud is obtained, which can then be interpreted in terms of some simplified structure such as faults. The aim of the approach is to give the simplest possible structure that is consistent with all the location and confidence ellipsoid data. The method is applied to three synthetic sets of data. These illustrate the potential and limitations of the method. Application to a real earthquake data set from Rabaul Caldera in Papua New Guinea gives an image of the caldera ring fault that suggests departures from the simple ring?fault structure previously assumed. Sensitivity analysis on the Rabaul data shows that the method is not unduly sensitive to the assumptions that have to be made in applying it.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Jones","given":"R.

  {"id":"Jonsson_2005_LessonsBe","abstract":"Our understanding of many geophysical phenomena has increased through model parameter estimations using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data. Good examples include InSAR observations of volcanic uplift that have in many cases allowed us to move beyond simple Mogi point-source representations of magma accumulation. Earthquake fault parameter estimations have also improved as InSAR data can provide constraints on fault geometry and location, as well as spatial variations of fault slip. The large number of published studies may seem to indicate that model parameter estimations using InSAR have become a simple routine task. However, there are still many problems in the way InSAR data are post-processed and treated in these estimations. These problems include data error characterization, phase unwrapping, data sub-sampling, estimation of model-parameter uncertainties, etc. Here we discuss some of these problems and possible methods to improve model parameter estimations. Unwanted signals or errors in InSAR deformation data come from various sources, such as from inaccurate orbit information, poor DEMs, unwrapping mistakes, interferometric decorrelation, and water vapor inhomogeneities in the atmosphere. The effect of some errors can be reduced by careful post-processing analysis while other errors remain in the data. Atmospheric errors are particularly difficult as they vary between interferograms and also within individual interferograms. These errors are spatially correlated with increasing noise power at larger spatial scales, but most researchers simply ignore these correlations, leading to biased model-parameter estimates, especially when the signal-to-noise ratio is low. We present results on under what circumstances the inclusion of the full data covariance matrix is important, as well as describing some practical methods on characterizing atmospheric errors. Another important issue is InSAR data sub-sampling. Interferograms contain millions of data points that make inversion calculations impractical. Several sub-sampling methods have been tried, such as regular sub-sampling, circular, quadtree, resolution based sub-sampling, etc. Here we discuss several schemes and compare them in earthquake model parameter estimations. In conclusion, it is clear that our understanding of how to treat InSAR data in source inversions has improved during the last few years, although there are still many lessons to be learned on identifying the methods that lead to the most reliable results.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Jonsson","given":"S."}],"citation-key":"Jonsson_2005_LessonsBe","container-title":"European Geoscience Union","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",12,1]]},"note":"ZSCC:00000\nADS Bibcode: 2005AGUFM.G41D..02J","page":"G41D-02","source":"NASA ADS","title":"Some Lessons to be Learned After a Decade of InSAR","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005AGUFM.G41D..02J","volume":"2005"},
  {"id":"Jonsson_2009_StressInteraction","abstract":"Understanding the state of stress within volcanoes and how it changes with active geophysical processes is important to assess when and where magma may propagate to the surface and initiate an eruption. Observations of volcanic deformation help to constrain parameters of models that can be used to describe these processes and to calculate the resulting stress changes within volcanoes. Here I use geodetic observations to constrain elastic dislocation models of magma accumulation and faulting at Sierra Negra volcano, Galápagos, in the years before the October 2005 eruption, which was the first eruption at Sierra Negra since 1979. Both InSAR and GPS data document a remarkable story of ~ 5 m pre-eruption uplift during 1992–2005, which was accompanied by at least three trapdoor faulting events on an intra-caldera fault system, in January 1998, April 2005, and just before the eruption in October 2005. The pattern of uplift observed in the InSAR data from different time periods during 1992–2005 is consistent with filling and pressurization of a 2.2 km deep sill under the caldera. Modeling results for the trapdoor faulting in April 2005, on the other hand, indicate that slip occurred on a thrust fault that dips steeply (71°) in towards the center of the caldera, and extends from the surface down to the sill at 2.2 km depth. Independently, the calculated stress changes caused by the inflating sill show that the Coulomb Failure Stress change (ΔCFS) at the fault's location is maximized on a 72° dipping thrust fault, agreeing almost exactly with the deformation modeling result, and implying that the inflation triggered the faulting. The calculations also show that the ΔCFS for optimally oriented faults (any strike and dip) is significantly larger in the southern part of the caldera, where the faulting took place, than at any other location. The trapdoor faulting in turn relieved the pressure within the sill, but caused compression to the south of the faults. This suggests that while the faulting provides a mechanism for the sill to thicken and postpone eruptions, it also prevents the sill from growing to the south.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Jónsson","given":"Sigurjón"}],"citation-key":"Jonsson_2009_StressInteraction","collection-title":"Understanding stress and deformation in active volcanoes","container-title":"Tectonophysics","container-title-short":"Tectonophysics","DOI":"10.1016/j.tecto.2008.08.005","ISSN":"0040-1951","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",6,9]]},"page":"36-44","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Stress interaction between magma accumulation and trapdoor faulting on Sierra Negra volcano, Galápagos","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040195108003880","volume":"471"},

The data include synthetic aperture radar interferograms (InSAR) from both ascending and descending orbits, radar amplitude image offset fields (SARIO) for both ascending and descending azimuth directions, and campaign GPS observations from 55 stations provided by Agnew et al. (2002). We model the fault with nine segments derived from the field-mapped fault rupture, the SARIO data, and aftershock locations. We first estimate the dip of each fault segment, as well as a single constant strike-slip component across each segment, resulting in an average dip of 83° to the northeast and slip of up to 5.6 m. Then, we fix the optimal fault segment dip, discretize the fault segments into 1.5 km × 1.5 km patches, and solve for the variable slip distribution using a nonnegative least-squares method that includes an appropriate degree of smoothing. Our preferred solution has both right-lateral strike-slip and reverse faulting. The estimated geodetic moment is 5.93 × 1019 N m (Mw 7.1), similar to seismological estimates, indicating that there are insignificant interseismic and postseismic deformation signals in the data. We find strike-slip displacements of up to 6.0 m and reverse faulting of up to 1.6 m, with the maximum slip located just northwest of the epicenter. Most of the slip is concentrated northwest and south of the epicenter; little slip is found on the northeastern branch of the fault. The SARIO data and our modeling indicate that the amount and extent of surface fault rupture were underestimated in the field.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Jónsson","given":"Sigurjón"},{"family":"Zebker","given":"Howard"},{"family":"Segall","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Amelung","given":"Falk"}],"citation-key":"Jonsson.etal_2002_FaultSlip","container-title":"Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America","container-title-short":"Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America","DOI":"10.1785/0120000922","ISSN":"0037-1106","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",5,1]]},"page":"1377-1389","source":"Silverchair","title":"Fault Slip Distribution of the 1999 Mw 7.1 Hector Mine, California, Earthquake, Estimated from Satellite Radar and GPS Measurements","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1785/0120000922","volume":"92"},

Some plate boundaries glide past each other smoothly, while others are punctuated by catastrophic failures. Some earthquakes stop after only a few hundred metres while others continue rupturing for a thousand kilometres. Earthquakes are sometimes triggered by other large earthquakes thousands of kilometres away. We address these questions by dissecting the observable phenomena and separating out the quantifiable features for comparison across events. We begin with a discussion of stress in the crust followed by an overview of earthquake phenomenology, focusing on the parameters that are readily measured by current seismic techniques. We briefly discuss how these parameters are related to the amplitude and frequencies of the elastic waves measured by seismometers as well as direct geodetic measurements of the Earth's deformation. We then review the major processes thought to be active during the rupture and discuss their relation to the observable parameters. We then take a longer range view by discussing how earthquakes interact as a complex system. Finally, we combine subjects to approach the key issue of earthquake initiation. This concluding discussion will require using the processes introduced in the study of rupture as well as some novel mechanisms. As our observational database improves, our computational ability accelerates and our laboratories become more refined, the next few decades promise to bring more insights on earthquakes and perhaps some answers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Kanamori","given":"Hiroo"},{"family":"Brodsky","given":"Emily E."}],"citation-key":"Kanamori.Brodsky_2004_PhysicsEarthquakes","container-title":"Reports on Progress in Physics","container-title-short":"Rep.

Here, we systematically explore the sensitivity of the surface velocity ﬁeld predicted by EDMs both early and late in the seismic cycle, to parameterizations of megathrust interface geometry, effective subducting plate thickness, and gradual transitions in apparent plate coupling. We focus on how these parameterizations affect the hingeline – the location where vertical velocities switch from subsidence to uplift – as well as the location of the peak uplift rates. We ﬁnd that these surface observables are much less sensitive to uncertainties in dip at the downdip end of the seismogenic zone for realistic curved faults in comparison to planar faults. For realistic megathrust geometries (planar or curved) having gradual transitions in apparent plate coupling, we ﬁnd that the extent of locking is best approximated at the surface by the location of peak uplift rates. Therefore, the common notion – based on shallow-dipping planar faults – that the hingeline is located directly above the maximum depth extent of the locked plate interface is generally incorrect. Using the hingeline as the basis for coupling may lead to a signiﬁcant underestimation of seismic hazard early in the cycle, as well as during the interseismic period. This analysis also demonstrates the importance of considering both vertical and horizontal velocities for determining seismic source extents, as well as interseismic coupling, on the megathrust. The tradeoffs presented here between the geometry of the megathrust and fault coupling along its surface can assist in the planning of campaign-GPS or ﬁeld geologic surveys, and help improve seismic hazard estimates in active subduction zones.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Kanda","given":"Ravi V.S."},{"family":"Simons","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"Kanda.Simons_2012_PracticalImplications","container-title":"Tectonophysics","container-title-short":"Tectonophysics","DOI":"10.1016/j.tecto.2012.06.040","ISSN":"00401951","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",8]]},"language":"en","page":"94-104","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Practical implications of the geometrical sensitivity of elastic dislocation models for field geologic surveys","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0040195112003654","volume":"560-561"},

However, recent observations provide new promising perspectives that advance knowledge. Here, we review data on the initiation processes of large earthquakes and show that they are multiscale and diverse, involving localization of deformation, fault heterogeneities and variable local loading rate effects. Analyses of seismic and geodetic data reveal evidence for regional weakening by earthquake-induced rock damage and progressive localization of deformation around the eventual rupture zones a few years before some large earthquakes. The final phase of deformation localization includes, depending on conditions, a mixture of slow slip transients and foreshocks at multiple spatial and temporal scales. The evolution of slip on large, localized faults shows a step-like increase that might reflect stress loading by previous failures, which can produce larger dynamic slip, in contrast to the smooth acceleration expected for a growing aseismic nucleation phase. We propose an integrated model to explain the diversity of large earthquake generation from progressive volumetric deformation to localized slip, which motivates future near-f ault seismic and geodetic studies with dense sensor networks and improved analysis techniques that can resolve multiscale processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Kato","given":"Aitaro"},{"family":"Ben-Zion","given":"Yehuda"}],"citation-key":"Kato.Ben-Zion_2021_GenerationLarge","container-title":"Nature Reviews Earth & Environment","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Earth Environ","DOI":"10.1038/s43017-020-00108-w","ISSN":"2662-138X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1]]},"language":"en","page":"26-39","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The generation of large earthquakes","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.nature.com/articles/s43017-020-00108-w","volume":"2"},

  {"id":"Kennedy.etal_2018_MagmaPlumbing","abstract":"Advancing our knowledge of caldera volcanoes enables better assessment of hazard and more efficient harnessing of resources. In this paper we review developments in concepts of magma storage and transport during the life cycle of caldera plumbing systems. We draw together: a) geological, geochemical and petrological data from intrusions and eruption deposits; b) geophysical and geochemical data from modern restless calderas; and c) geological and structural evidence from ancient calderas as well as insights from numerical and analogue models. Overall, magma plumbing systems beneath calderas develop incrementally as magma rises, intrudes and rejuvenates. Eventually accumulation and eruption of a sufficient magma volume drives subsidence of the plumbing system roof to form a caldera. The magma plumbing system may then reside relatively unchanged or continue to re-intrude on a variety of scales. Consequences include continued eruptions, crustal resurgence, or new cycles of caldera formation. Large magma volumes characteristic of calderas may evolve as a single progressively-enlarging reservoir or through the rapid amalgamation of small, initially-independent magma pockets. Eruptible magmas may reside at depths of up to 17km, but typically lie at shallower depths as a caldera system evolves. Timescales of sub-caldera magma residence reveal two remarkable concepts: (1) portions of melt within a magma may remain molten for >106years, and (2) melt can be created and mobilized in a few thousand years or less. Geophysical and geochemical data illustrate the present state of active sub-caldera plumbing systems and their development on timescales of hours to years. These studies commonly reveal aseismic, low-velocity zones at depths >6km with spatial extents that can be larger than the caldera. The seismic attributes are consistent with rock hosting magma bodies of variable volume and melt content. These are commonly overlain by shallower low-velocity zones linked with ground deformation. The exact nature of these shallower zones is unclear, but interpretations often include shallow sills and laccoliths, and hydrothermal circulation is likely a key process as well. Seismicity and geodetic data record the interplay between magma movement and crustal deformation at calderas. Together with evidence from field studies, numerical simulations and analogue models, such data show that magma migration at calderas may involve considerable lateral transport through dykes or sills to a site of eruption. While caldera-related magma intrusions commonly exploit structures produced by caldera subsidence, they may also follow regional tectonic structures that extend well beyond the border of the caldera. The increased structural complexity that occurs as a caldera evolves increases the permeability of the crust. This may promote small volume eruptions and shallow storage of magma in the post-collapse phase. Our review highlights the significant progress made in understanding the range of intrusion styles and timescales that define the magma plumbing beneath calderas. Yet there are still key questions that limit the application of this understanding to directly benefit humanity: (1) What are the limits to the detection of shallow magma bodies, and can we assess the eruption risks associated with magma bodies of different sizes, depths, compositions and crystal contents? (2) Is it viable to generate electricity by extracting heat directly from magma through the sub-caldera plumbing system? Geophysical and drillhole data from Krafla caldera, Iceland, show that rhyolite can exist undetected at shallow levels within the caldera and may not represent a hazard even when intersected by a borehole. Current work at Krafla is assessing the possibility of extracting geothermal energy from shallow magma bodies and/or superheated steam zones directly above. However, the extent and connectivity of this magma to larger volumes in time and space, as well as its applicability to other systems, may only be answered with continued focused magma drilling, geophysical experimentation and geological exploration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",2,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Kennedy","given":"B.

  {"id":"Khoshmanesh.etal_2015_TimeDependent","abstract":"The Central segment of San Andreas Fault (CSAF) is characterized by a nearly continuous right-lateral aseismic slip. However, observations of the creep rate obtained using small characteristically repeating earthquakes (CREs) show pulses of creep along the CSAF, which may indicate spatially and temporally variable seismic hazard along the CSAF. Therefore, the goal of this study is to obtain a high-resolution time-dependent model of creep along the CSAF to examine this hypothesis. To this end, we apply a time-dependent creep modeling approach, which combines interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) surface deformation time series and observations of fault creep obtained from CREs. The SAR data set includes C band scenes acquired by the ERS-2 and Envisat satellites between 2003 and 2011. The resulting creep rate distribution implies a peak rate up to 32 mm/yr along the central part of the CSAF. Afterslip due to the 2004 Parkﬁeld earthquake on the southeastern segment of the CSAF is also manifest in the model, and there is clear evidence of creep pulsing along strike and depth of the CSAF. Estimated annual rate of slip deﬁcit accumulation is equivalent to a magnitude 5.6–5.7 earthquake. Taking advantage of the time-dependence of our model, we also reﬁne the scaling relationship, which associates the released seismic moment due to a CRE event with the amount of creep on the fault, surrounding the CRE patches. This study provides the ﬁrst kinematic model of creep pulsing, constrained using geodetic and seismic data, which can enhance time-dependent seismic hazard maps and improve earthquake operational forecast models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Khoshmanesh","given":"M."},{"family":"Shirzaei","given":"M."},{"family":"Nadeau","given":"R.

  {"id":"Kim.etal_2016_ChangesRepeating","abstract":"Finite-source inversions are performed using small earthquake waveforms as empirical Green’s functions (eGf) to investigate the rupture process of repeating earthquakes along the San Andreas Fault in Parkﬁeld, California. The eGf waveform inversion method is applied to a repeating Mw 2.1 Parkﬁeld earthquake sequence using three-component velocity waveforms recorded by an array of borehole seismometers. The obtained models show a circular slip distribution with a ~20 m radius, a 3.0–4.2 cm average slip of the main asperity, and peak displacement of 10.6–13.5 cm. The static stress drop distribution shows that the main asperity has a peak stress drop of 69.5–94.7 MPa. The inversion results support an earlier ﬁnding by Dreger et al. (2007) that high-strength asperities exist in the rupture areas of the Mw 2.1 events at Parkﬁeld. In addition, notable temporal peak slip and stress drop reduction was observed after the 2004 Parkﬁeld event while the average value remains constant (~12 MPa) over time. These events may represent mechanically strong sections of the fault, surrounded by regions that are undergoing continuous deformation (creep), Given repeated loading of the strong asperities, it would be expected that these similar repeating earthquakes should also have very similar slip distributions since surrounding regions are deforming aseismically. There are small differences in the waveforms of these repeating earthquakes, and this could be because of rupture nucleation points not being in exactly the same location within the region of the fault that is capable of stick-slip behavior. Our result indicates that waveform slip inversion is needed to reveal spatial and temporal variations of the stress drop within the rupture area to improve understanding of fault healing and rupture mechanics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Ahyi"},{"family":"Dreger","given":"Douglas S."},{"family":"Taira","given":"Taka'aki"},{"family":"Nadeau","given":"Robert M."}],"citation-key":"Kim.etal_2016_ChangesRepeating","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"King.etal_1994_StaticStress","abstract":"To understand whether the 1992 M = 7.4 Landers earthquake changed the proximity to failure on the San Andreas fault system, we examine the general problem of how one earthquake might trigger another. The tendency of rocks to fail in a brittle manner is thought to be a function of both shear and confining stresses, commonly formulated as the Coulomb failure criterion. Here we explore how changes in Coulomb conditions associated with one or more earthquakes may trigger subsequent events. We first consider a Coulomb criterion appropriate for the production of aftershocks, where faults most likely to slip are those optimally orientated for failure as a result of the prevailing regional stress field and the stress change caused by the mainshock. We find that the distribution of aftershocks for the Landers earthquake, as well as for several other moderate events in its vicinity, can be explained by the Coulomb criterion as follows: aftershocks are abundant where the Coulomb stress on optimally orientated faults rose by more than one-half bar, and aftershocks are sparse where the Coulomb stress dropped by a similar amount. Further, we find that several moderate shocks raised the stress at the future Landers epicenter and along much of the Landers rupture zone by about a bar, advancing the Landers shock by 1 to 3 centuries. The Landers rupture, in turn, raised the stress at site of the future M = 6.5 Big Bear aftershock site by 3 bars. The Coulomb stress change on a specified fault is independent of regional stress but depends on the fault geometry, sense of slip, and the coefficient of friction. We use this method to resolve stress changes on the San Andreas and San Jacinto faults imposed by the Landers sequence. Together the Landers and Big Bear earthquakes raised the stress along the San Bernardino segment of the southern San Andreas fault by 2 to 6 bars, hastening the next great earthquake there by about a decade.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,16]]},"author":[{"family":"King","given":"Geoffrey C.

  {"id":"Klinger.etal_1999_ActiveFaulting","abstract":"On 22 November 1995 the largest earthquake instrumentally recorded in the area, with magnitude MW 7.3, occurred in the Gulf of Aqaba. The main rupture corresponding to the strike-slip mechanism is located within the gulf of Aqaba, which forms the marine extension of the Levantine fault, also known as the Dead Sea fault. The Levantine fault accommodates the strike-slip movement between the African plate and the Arabian plate. The Gulf of Aqaba itself is usually described as the succession of three deep pull-apart basins, elongated in the N-S direction. Concerning historical seismicity, only two large events have been reported for the last 2000 years, but they are still poorly constrained. The seismicity recorded since installation of regional networks in the early 1980s had been characterized by a low background level punctuated by brief swarmlike activity a few months in duration. Three swarms have already been documented in the Gulf of Aqaba in 1983, 1990, and 1993, with magnitudes reaching at most 6.1 (MW). We suggest that the geometry of the rupture for the 1995 event is related to the spatial distribution of these previous swarms. Body-wave modeling of broadband seismograms from the global network, along with the analysis of the aftershock distribution, allow us to propose a well-constrained model for the rupture process. Northward propagation of the rupture has been found. We have demonstrated that three successive subevents are necessary to obtain a good fit between observed and synthetic wave forms. The total seismic moment released was 7.42 × 1019 N-m. The location of the subsevents shows that the three stages of the rupture involve three different segments within the gulf. Substantial surface breakage showing only normal motion (up to 20 cm) affecting beachrock was observed along the Egyptian coast. We show that these ruptures are only a secondary feature and are in no case primary ruptures. The stress tensor derived from striations collected in quaternary sediments shows radial extension.

  {"id":"Klinger.etal_2000_SeismicBehaviour","abstract":"The Dead Sea fault zone is a major left-lateral strike-slip fault. South of the Dead Sea basin, the Wadi Araba fault extends over 160 km to the Gulf of Aqaba. The Dead Sea fault zone is known to have produced several relatively large historical earthquakes. However, the historical events are unequally distributed along the fault and only four events have been reported in the Araba valley over the last few thousands of years. Magnitudes estimated from the historical record are probably slightly smaller than that≰of the Mw 7.3 earthquake that struck the Gulf of Aqaba in 1995. The fault cuts straight across Pleistocene to Holocene alluvium and shows morphologic evidence for essentially pure strike-slip motion. Regional seismic monitoring reveals little microseismicity along the fault except around the Dead Sea and Gulf of Aqaba, where the fault splays into complex pull-apart basin fault systems. We have investigated the fault zone at several sites selected from SPOT images and the study of aerial photography. At the site of the now destroyed Tilah Castle, a well-preserved wall, dated to be about 1200 yr BP (14C age on charcoal), is cut by the fault and offset by 2.2 m. Comparison with offset gullies at a nearby site 3 km to the north and at three other sites, respectively 25, 50 and 65 km to the south, reveals that this specific fault displacement is probably related to the last seismic event that ruptured that fault segment, possibly in AD 1458.Moreover, the offset gullies suggest a characteristic slip behaviour with recurring slip of about 1.5 m on average. Given the 4 ± 2 mm yr−1 slip rate derived for this fault segment, we infer that the fault should produce Mw 7 earthquakes along some segment in the Araba valley about every 200 years. The historical period, with only four well-documented large earthquakes in AD 1068, AD 1212, AD 1293 and AD 1458, thus appears to have been relatively quiescent, with a 20 per cent deficit of Mw 7 earthquakes. However, our data do not exclude the possibility of larger Mw 7.6 earthquakes or time clustering of earthquakes over longer timespans. An alternative seismic behaviour involves Mw 7.6 earthquakes about every 6000 years and Mw 7 earthquakes about every 250 years. The historical catalogue would then appear to be complete for Mw 7 earthquakes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Klinger","given":"Y."},{"family":"Avouac","given":"J.

  {"id":"Klinger.etal_2000_SlipRate","abstract":"The Araba valley lies between the southern tip of the Dead Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba. This depression, blanketed with alluvial and lacustrine deposits, is cut along its entire length by the Dead Sea fault. In many places the fault is well defined by scarps, and evidence for left-lateral strike-slip faulting is abundant. The slip rate on the fault can be constrained from dated geomorphic features displaced by the fault. A large fan at the mouth of Wadi Dahal has been displaced by about 500 m since the bulk of the fanglomerates were deposited 77-140 kyr ago, as dated from cosmogenic isotope analysis (10Be in chert) of pebbles collected on the fan surface and from the age of transgressive lacustrine sediments capping the fan. Holocene alluvial surfaces are also clearly offset. By correlation with similar surfaces along the Dead Sea lake margin, we propose a chronology for their emplacement. Taken together, our observations suggest an average slip rate over the Late Pleistocene of between 2 and 6 mm yr−1, with a preferred value of 4 mm yr−1. This slip rate is shown to be consistent with other constraints on the kinematics of the Arabian plate, assuming a rotation rate of about 0.396° Myr−1 around a pole at 31.1°N, 26.7°E relative to Africa.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Klinger","given":"Y."},{"family":"Avouac","given":"J.

The dInSAR phase acquired by the satellite sensor is a superposition of different contributions, and when studying geophysical processes, we are usually only interested in the surface deformation part of the signal. Therefore, to obtain high-quality results, we would like to characterize and/or remove other phase components. A stochastic model has been found to be appropriate to describe atmospheric phase delay in dInSAR images. However, these phase delays are usually modeled as being isotropic, which is a simplification, because InSAR images often show directional atmospheric anomalies. Here, we analyze anisotropic structures and show validation results using both real and simulated data. We calculate experimental semivariograms of the dInSAR phase in several European Remote Sensing satellite-1/2 tandem interferograms. Based on the theory of random functions (RFs), we then fit anisotropic variogram models in the spatial domain, employing Mate¿rn- and Bessel-family correlation functions in nested models to represent complex dInSAR covariance structures. The presented covariance function types, in the statistical framework of stationary RFs, are consistent with tropospheric delay models. We find that by using anisotropic data covariance information to weight dInSAR measurements, we can significantly improve both the precision and accuracy of geophysical parameter estimations. Furthermore, the improvement is dependent on how similar the deformation pattern is to the dominant structure of the anisotropic atmospheric signals.","author":[{"family":"Knospe","given":"Steffen"},{"family":"Jonsson","given":"Sigurjón"}],"citation-key":"Knospe.Jonsson_2010_CovarianceEstimation","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","DOI":"10.1109/TGRS.2009.2033937","ISSN":"1558-0644","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",4]]},"note":"ZSCC:00061","page":"2057-2065","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Covariance Estimation for dInSAR Surface Deformation Measurements in the Presence of Anisotropic Atmospheric Noise","type":"article-journal","volume":"48"},

  {"id":"Konstantinou.etal_2003_AnalysisBroadband","abstract":"Large earthquakes near active volcanoes, that exhibit non-double-couple source properties are usually interpreted as result the of either magma intrusion or geometrical complexity along the fault plane. Such an earthquake occurred in 1996 September 29 at Bárdarbunga volcano in central Iceland, to be followed 2 days later by a major volcanic eruption at the area between Bárdarbunga and the nearby Grimsvötn volcano. Both of these active volcanic centres lie underneath the Vatnajökull glacier, a permanent ice cap that covers a large area of central Iceland. This event was recorded by a temporary network (HOTSPOT) that consisted of 30 broad-band three-component seismometers covering most of Iceland. The waveforms of this event at all stations show an emergent, low-amplitude, high-frequency onset that is superposed on a longer-period signal. The corresponding amplitude spectra show a low-frequency content (&lt;1 Hz) and prominent peaks around the corner frequency (∼0.25 Hz) and higher frequencies. These regional waveforms were inverted in order to obtain the best-fitting deviatoric and full moment tensor using a linear, time-domain inversion method. The results for the deviatoric moment tensor indicate a large (∼60 per cent) compensated linear vector dipole (CLVD) component, a hypocentral depth of 3.5 km, a moment magnitude of 5.4 and a best double-couple solution showing thrust motion in good agreement with the previously published Harvard CMT solution. The results for the full moment tensor on the other hand, indicate an implosive isotropic component of 8.5 per cent, a reduced CLVD component of 47.2 per cent and a best double-couple solution showing normal faulting. However, a statistical F-test revealed that the full moment tensor does not fit the data significantly better than the deviatoric at a confidence level of not more than 76 per cent. All of these results were found not to change substantially when a different source time function was used or when the data were weighted according to their distance from the source. The data are consistent with an earthquake of this magnitude, caused by the failure of an asperity and the formation of a tensile crack due to increasing fluid pressure. The dimensions of the crack may have been 10 × 3 km2 and 0.5 m thickness and the volume of the injected fluid was found to be 15 × 106 m3. The calculated viscosity for the fluid (0.04 Pa s) points to the possibility of water being injected rather than magma, that is also supported by the short source duration of the earthquake (∼5 s). Taking into account the water saturation of the upper crust in Vatnajökull due to the presence of the glacier, this event may have been caused by increased pressure of water that was heated by magma injected through a dyke below the asperity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Konstantinou","given":"Konstantinos I."},{"family":"Kao","given":"Honn"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Cheng-Horng"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Wen-Tzong"}],"citation-key":"Konstantinou.etal_2003_AnalysisBroadband","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","container-title-short":"Geophys J Int","DOI":"10.1046/j.1365-246X.2003.01932.x","ISSN":"0956-540X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"134-145","source":"academic.oup.com","title":"Analysis of broad-band regional waveforms of the 1996 September 29 earthquake at Bárdarbunga volcano, central Iceland: investigation of the magma injection hypothesis","title-short":"Analysis of broad-band regional waveforms of the 1996 September 29 earthquake at Bárdarbunga volcano, central Iceland","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/154/1/134/603411","volume":"154"},

  {"id":"Kreemer.etal_2003_IntegratedGlobal","abstract":"In this paper we present a global model (GSRM-1) of both horizontal velocities on the Earth’s surface and horizontal strain rates for almost all deforming plate boundary zones. A model strain rate ﬁeld is obtained jointly with a global velocity ﬁeld in the process of solving for a global velocity gradient tensor ﬁeld. In our model we perform a least-squares ﬁt between model velocities and observed geodetic velocities, as well as between model strain rates and observed geological strain rates. Model velocities and strain rates are interpolated over a spherical Earth using bi-cubic Bessel splines. We include 3000 geodetic velocities from 50 different, mostly published, studies. Geological strain rates are obtained for central Asia only and they are inferred from Quaternary fault slip rates. For all areas where no geological information is included a priori constraints are placed on the style and direction (but not magnitude) of the model strain rate ﬁeld. These constraints are taken from a seismic strain rate ﬁeld inferred from (normalized) focal mechanisms of shallow earthquakes. We present a global solution of the second invariant of the model strain rate ﬁeld as well as strain rate solutions for a few selected plate boundary zones. Generally, the strain rate tensor ﬁeld is consistent with geological and seismological data. With the assumption of plate rigidity for all areas other than the plate boundary zones we also present relative angular velocities for most plate pairs. We ﬁnd that in general there is a good agreement between the present-day plate motions we obtain and longterm plate motions, but a few signiﬁcant differences exist. The rotation rates for the Indian, Arabian and Nubian plates relative to Eurasia are 30, 13 and 50 per cent slower than the NUVEL1A estimate, respectively, and the rotation rate for the Nazca Plate relative to South America is 17 per cent slower. On the other hand, Caribbean–North America motion is 76 per cent faster than the NUVEL-1A estimate. While crustal blocks in the India–Eurasia collision zone move signiﬁcantly and self-consistently with respect to bounding plates, only a very small motion is predicted between the Nubian and Somalian plates. By integrating plate boundary zone deformation with the traditional modelling of angular velocities of rigid plates we have obtained a model that has already been proven valuable in, for instance, redeﬁning a no-net-rotation model of surface motions and by conﬁrming a global correlation between seismicity rates and tectonic moment rates along subduction zones and within zones of continental deformation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Kreemer","given":"Corné"},{"family":"Holt","given":"William E."},{"family":"Haines","given":"A.

Discriminating these seasonal signals from other sources of deformation in geodetic measurements is essential to isolate tectonic signals and to monitor spatio-temporal variations in continental water storage. We propose a new methodology to identify and extract these seasonal signals. The approach uses a variational Bayesian Independent Component Analysis (vbICA) to extract the seasonal signals and a gravity-based deformation model to identify which of these signals are caused by surface loading. We test the procedure on two study areas, the Arabian Peninsula and the Nepal Himalaya, and find that the technique successfully extracts the seasonal signals with one or two independent components, depending on whether the load is stationary or moving. The approach is robust to spatial heterogeneities inherent to geodetic measurements and can help extract systematic errors in geodetic products (e.g., draconitic errors).

  {"id":"Larochelle.etal_2022_UnderstandingGeodetic","abstract":"The continuous redistribution of water involved in the hydrologic cycle leads to deformation of the solid Earth. On a global scale, this deformation is well explained by the loading imposed by hydrological mass variations and can be quantified to first order with space-based gravimetric and geodetic measurements. At the regional scale, however, aquifer systems also undergo poroelastic deformation in response to groundwater fluctuations. Disentangling these related but distinct 3D deformation fields from geodetic time series is essential to accurately invert for changes in continental water mass, to understand the mechanical response of aquifers to internal pressure changes as well as to correct time series for these known effects. Here, we demonstrate a methodology to accomplish this task by considering the example of the well-instrumented Ozark Plateaus Aquifer System (OPAS) in the central United States. We begin by characterizing the most important sources of groundwater level variations in the spatially heterogeneous piezometer dataset using an Independent Component Analysis. Then, to estimate the associated poroelastic displacements, we project geodetic time series corrected for hydrological loading effects onto the dominant groundwater temporal functions.

In particular, the relatively low estimates of elastic moduli inferred from the poroelastic displacements and groundwater fluctuations may be indicative of aquifer layers with a high fracture density. Our findings suggest that OPAS undergoes significant poroelastic deformation, including highly heterogeneous horizontal poroelastic displacements.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Larochelle","given":"Stacy"},{"family":"Chanard","given":"Kristel"},{"family":"Fleitout","given":"Luce"},{"family":"Fortin","given":"Jérôme"},{"family":"Gualandi","given":"Adriano"},{"family":"Longuevergne","given":"Laurent"},{"family":"Rebischung","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Violette","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Avouac","given":"Jean‐Philippe"}],"citation-key":"Larochelle.etal_2022_UnderstandingGeodetic","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","container-title-short":"JGR Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/2021JB023097","ISSN":"2169-9313, 2169-9356","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC:00003","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Understanding the Geodetic Signature of Large Aquifer Systems: Example of the Ozark Plateaus in Central United States","title-short":"Understanding the Geodetic Signature of Large Aquifer Systems","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021JB023097","volume":"127"},
  {"id":"Lau.etal_2021_FrequencyDependent","abstract":"Studies of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) often use paleoshorelines and present-day deformation to constrain the viscosity of the mantle and the thickness of the elastic lithosphere. However, several studies focused on similar locations have resulted in different estimates of these physical properties. We argue that these different estimates infer apparent viscosities and apparent lithospheric elastic thicknesses, dependent on the timescale of deformation. We use recently derived relationships between these frequency dependent apparent quantities and the underlying thermodynamic conditions to produce predictions of viscoelastic properties and lithospheric thickness across a broad spectrum of geophysical timescales for two Antarctic locations (Amundsen Sea Embayment and the Antarctic Peninsula). Our predictions are constrained by input from seismic tomography, require the self-consistent consideration of elastic, viscous, and transient rheological behavior and also include non-linear steady state viscosity, which have been determined by several laboratories. We demonstrate that when the full spectrum of viscoelasticity is considered, lithospheric thickness displays a significant range across frequency and that transient creep may play an important role across the timescales relevant for the GIA studies we explore. We suggest that observational studies could move toward a framework of determining the frequency dependence of viscoelastic quantities—rather than single, frequency independent values of viscosity. There remains much work to accomplish this both theoretically and observationally, but the eventual result would provide deeper insight into the rheological behavior of Earth.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Lau","given":"H.

Non-uniform slip extended ~220 km across the width and ~400 km along strike of the subduction zone. Extensive data provided by regional networks of seismic and geodetic stations in Japan and global networks of broadband seismic stations, regional and global ocean bottom pressure sensors and sea level measurement stations, seaﬂoor GPS/ Acoustic displacement sites, repeated multi-channel reﬂection images, extensive coastal runup and inundation observations, and in situ sampling of the shallow fault zone materials and temperature perturbation, make the event the best-recorded and most extensively studied great earthquake to date. An eﬀort is made here to identify the more robust attributes of the rupture as well as less well constrained, but likely features. Other issues involve the degree to which the rupture corresponded to geodetically-deﬁned preceding slip-deﬁcit regions, the inﬂuence of re-rupture of slip regions for large events in the past few centuries, and relationships of coseismic slip to precursory slow slip, foreshocks, aftershocks, afterslip, and relocking of the megathrust. Frictional properties associated with the slip heterogeneity and in situ measurements of frictional heating of the shallow fault zone support low stress during shallow sliding and near-total shear stress drop of ~10–30 MPa in large-slip regions in the shallow megathrust. The roles of fault morphology, sediments, ﬂuids, and dynamical processes in the rupture behavior continue to be examined; consensus has not yet been achieved. The possibility of secondary sources of tsunami excitation such as inelastic deformation of the sedimentary wedge or submarine slumping remains undemonstrated; dislocation models in an elastic continuum appear to suﬃciently account for most mainshock observations, although afterslip and viscoelastic processes remain contested.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Lay","given":"Thorne"}],"citation-key":"Lay_2018_ReviewRupture","container-title":"Tectonophysics","container-title-short":"Tectonophysics","DOI":"10.1016/j.tecto.2017.09.022","ISSN":"00401951","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",5]]},"language":"en","page":"4-36","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A review of the rupture characteristics of the 2011 Tohoku-oki Mw 9.1 earthquake","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0040195117303992","volume":"733"},

However, full exploitation of the potential of Sentinel-1 requires specific processing approaches as well as the efficient use of modern computing and data storage facilities. Here we present Looking Into Continents from Space with Synthetic Aperture Radar (LiCSAR), an operational system built for large-scale interferometric processing of Sentinel-1 data. LiCSAR is designed to automatically produce geocoded wrapped and unwrapped interferograms and coherence estimates, for large regions, at 0.001° resolution (WGS-84 coordinate system). The products are continuously updated at a frequency depending on prioritised regions (monthly, weekly or live update strategy). The products are open and freely accessible and downloadable through an online portal. We describe the algorithms, processing, and storage solutions implemented in LiCSAR, and show several case studies that use LiCSAR products to measure tectonic and volcanic deformation.

On the basis of two GPS campaign measurements, 6 years apart, at 17 sites distributed in Israel and Jordan, complemented by Israeli permanent stations, we compute the present-day deformation across the southern segment of the Dead Sea Transform, the Wadi Araba fault. Elastic locked-fault modeling of fault-parallel velocities provides a slip rate of 4.9 ± 1.4 mm/a and a best fit locking depth of ∼12 km. This slip rate is slightly higher than previous results based only on Israeli permanent GPS stations data, which are located west of the fault. It is in good agreement with results based on offset geomorphologic and geologic features that average longer periods of time (10 ka to 1 Ma). Projection in ITRF2000 reference frame allows using our data, combined with results published earlier, to further study the kinematics between Arabia, Nubia, and Sinai. Systematic combination of Euler poles available in the literature, in addition to our new set of data, shows that a wide range of Arabia-Sinai pole positions and angular velocities predict reasonable slip rate on the Dead Sea fault. We highlight uncertainties of calculating such poles due to the small size of the blocks and their slow relative motion along a short and almost straight strand of the transform fault, which lead to a large trade-off between pole location and angular velocity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Le Beon","given":"Maryline"},{"family":"Klinger","given":"Yann"},{"family":"Amrat","given":"Abdel Qader"},{"family":"Agnon","given":"Amotz"},{"family":"Dorbath","given":"Louis"},{"family":"Baer","given":"Gidon"},{"family":"Ruegg","given":"Jean-Claude"},{"family":"Charade","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Mayyas","given":"Omar"}],"citation-key":"LeBeon.etal_2008_SlipRate","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/2007JB005280","ISSN":"2156-2202","issue":"B11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Slip rate and locking depth from GPS profiles across the southern Dead Sea Transform","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2007JB005280","volume":"113"},

Although the reduction is strongest at surface seismometers in populated areas, this seismic quiescence extends for many kilometers radially and hundreds of meters in depth.

A secondary large asperity was found in the deeper subduction zone beneath the hypocenter. The average slip on the fault is ~15 m and the maximum displacement on the biggest asperity is > 30 m. The temporal rupture process shows that the slip nucleated near the hypocenter at the beginning, and then ruptured to the shallow fault plane forming the largest asperity. The slip developed in the deeper subduction zone in the second stage. Finally, the rupture propagated toward the north and south of the fault along the Japan Trench. The source time function shows three segments of energy releases with two large peaks related to the development of the asperities. The overall rupture process is ~180 seconds.

High elevation, moderate relief and low vegetation cover in eastern Tibet ensure reliable multi-temporal InSAR results. We automatically process seven 1,200 km long ascending and descending orbits, divided into 2 or 3 overlapping segments along-track. Linear phase ramps in range and azimuth are removed from interferograms. The ramps and the flattened interferograms are separately inverted into time series and analyzed. The ramps are modeled by their Solid Earth Tides (SET) contribution, seasonal variations, and a trend in time. SET oscillations are clearly visible in the ramp time series. Seasonal tidal amplifications of probable atmospheric origin are also evidenced. Ramp rates are shown to precisely quantify the plate motion of each segment in the ITRF reference frame. They are thus added back to the velocity maps before along-track merging. Then, a simple referencing procedure implying only a constant and a tilt in azimuth adjusted for each track is constrained by horizontal GNSS data. It allows straightforward vertical and horizontal decomposition. The quality of the merged and referenced data sets can then be quantitatively assessed at 1 mm/yr by the differences between InSAR and GNSS velocities and by the InSAR residuals on track overlaps. The vertical velocity field is dominated at first order by the effect of permafrost degradation, while the horizontal velocity highlights strain accumulation across major strike-slip faults in eastern Tibet.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Lemrabet","given":"Laëtitia"},{"family":"Doin","given":"Marie-Pierre"},{"family":"Lasserre","given":"Cécile"},{"family":"Durand","given":"Philippe"}],"citation-key":"Lemrabet.etal_2023_ReferencingContinentalScale","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/2022JB026251","ISSN":"2169-9356","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2023.

Toward these goals, we develop and apply a deconvolved autocorrelation (DA) method to estimate regional daily and seasonal changes of seismic velocities in southern California. The DA method combines advantages of traditional autocorrelation and Horizontal-to-Vertical Spectral Ratio, and is used to analyze over 10 years of data recorded by 50 stations. The results indicate widespread daily and seasonal changes of up to 10% and 4%, respectively, in the top tens of meters of the crust. The thickness of the surface layer, distance from the coast, and topographic variations are important factors controlling the amplitudes of the resolved velocity variations.

The fault has been documented to be creeping at the surface for decades; however, the spatial and temporal distributions of shallow creep along the fault are not well resolved. In this study, we obtain high-resolution interseismic velocity maps along the 350-km-long central Xianshuihe Fault and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time series along the Kangding segment using ascending and descending Sentinel-1 data. The InSAR data reveal multiple creeping sections and the estimated surface creep rates show high along-strike variability. A coupling model characterizes the distribution of creep with depth. The seismic potential of apparent rupture asperities along the Xianshuihe Fault is further refined by considering fault-crossing baseline data and the distribution of historical ruptures and microseismicity. Moreover, a stress-driven afterslip model of the observed accelerated creep around the Mw 5.9 2014 Kangding rupture indicates substantial shallow afterslip, which provides further constraints on the distribution of locked and creeping patches along this section of the Xianshuihe Fault.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Yuexin"},{"family":"Bürgmann","given":"Roland"}],"citation-key":"Li.Burgmann_2021_PartialCoupling","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/2020JB021406","ISSN":"2169-9356","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"e2020JB021406","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Partial Coupling and Earthquake Potential Along the Xianshuihe Fault, China","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020JB021406","volume":"126"},

  {"id":"Li.etal_2021_GroundDeformation","abstract":"Improvement of our understanding of the role of ground deformation due to viscoelastic relaxation following eruptions is important, as the generated signals can resemble renewed magma inflow. We study post-eruptive unrest at the subglacial Bárðarbunga volcano, Iceland, after a caldera collapse and major magma drainage in 2014–2015. Elevated seismicity began about 6 months after the eruption ended, including nine Mlw > 4.5 earthquakes. Global Navigation Satellite System and Sentinel-1 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar geodesy are applied to evaluate post-eruptive ground deformation from 2015 to 2018. Horizontal velocities locally exceed 10 cm/year and rapidly decay with distance away from the caldera. We explore two end-member models and their combination to explain the post-eruptive deformation field: 1) viscoelastic relaxation caused by the co-eruptive caldera collapse and magma withdrawal, and 2) renewed magma inflow. We find parameter combinations for each model that explain the observed ground deformation. The purely viscoelastic relaxation model, consisting of a half-space composed of a 7-km thick elastic layer on top of a viscoelastic layer with a viscosity of 3.0 × 1018 Pa s reproduces broadly the observations. A simple magma inflow model consisting of a single point source with an inflow rate of 1 × 107 m3/year at 0.7 km depth broadly fits the observations, but may be unrealistic. A more elaborate model of magma inflow into a 10-km deep sill combined with slip on the caldera ring fault explains the observations well. Our results suggest that the co-eruptive deformation field is likely influenced by viscoelastic relaxation, renewed magma inflow, or a combination of both processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Siqi"},{"family":"Sigmundsson","given":"Freysteinn"},{"family":"Drouin","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Parks","given":"Michelle M."},{"family":"Ófeigsson","given":"Benedikt G."},{"family":"Jónsdóttir","given":"Kristín"},{"family":"Grapenthin","given":"Ronni"},{"family":"Geirsson","given":"Halldór"},{"family":"Hooper","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Hreinsdóttir","given":"Sigrún"}],"citation-key":"Li.etal_2021_GroundDeformation","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/2020JB020157","ISSN":"2169-9356","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"e2020JB020157","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Ground Deformation After a Caldera Collapse: Contributions of Magma Inflow and Viscoelastic Response to the 2015–2018 Deformation Field Around Bárðarbunga, Iceland","title-short":"Ground Deformation After a Caldera Collapse","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020JB020157","volume":"126"},

However, due to the lack of modern megathrust earthquake records and general quiescence of subduction fault seismicity, the potential megathrust rupture scenario and influence of downdip limit of the seismogenic zone are still obscure. In this study, we present a numerical simulation of Cascadia subduction zone earthquake sequences in the laboratory-derived rate-and-state friction framework to investigate the potential influence of the geodetic fault locking on the megathrust sequences. We consider the rate-state friction stability parameter constrained by geodetic fault locking models derived from decadal GPS records, tidal gauge and levelling-derived uplift rate data along the Cascadia margin. We incorporate historical coseismic subsidence inferred from coastal marine sediments to validate our coseismic rupture scenarios. Earthquake rupture pattern is strongly controlled by the downdip width of the seismogenic, velocity-weakening zone and by the earthquake nucleation zone size. In our model, along-strike heterogeneous characteristic slip distance is required to generate margin-wide ruptures that result in reasonable agreement between the synthetic and observed coastal subsidence for the AD 1700 Cascadia Mw∼9.0 megathrust rupture.

We perform InSAR time series analysis and evaluate these ionospheric effects using data acquired on both ascending (dusk-side of the Sentinel-1 dawn–dusk orbit) and descending (dawn-side) tracks over representative midlatitude and low-latitude (geomagnetic latitude) areas. We ﬁnd that the ionospheric effects are very strong for data acquired at low latitudes on ascending tracks. For other cases, ionospheric effects are not strong or even negligible.

These delays are described as one of the primary error sources in InSAR observations. Although independent atmospheric measurements have been used to correct TDs, their sparse spatial or temporal resolution requires interpolation, leading to uncertainties in the corrected interferograms. The performance of the conventional phase-based correction method is weakened by the presence of confounding signals (e.g., TDs, deformation, and topographic errors) and spatial variability of the troposphere. Here, we propose a method that can simultaneously estimate stratified TDs together with parameters of deformation and topographic error based on their distinct spatial-temporal correlation. Spatial variability of the relationship between TDs and topographic height is addressed through localized estimation in windows divided by quadtree according to height gradient.

In particular, we combine more than 100 survey-mode GPS velocities with InSAR data from Envisat descending tracks 84 and 356 and ascending tracks 77 and 306 (149 total acquisitions), processed using a persistent scatterers method. The result is a dense map of interseismic velocities across the Imperial Fault and surrounding areas that allows us to evaluate the rate of interseismic loading and along-strike variations in surface creep. We compare available geodetic data to models of the earthquake cycle with rate- and state-dependent friction and ﬁnd that a complete record of the earthquake cycle is required to constrain key fault properties including the rate-dependence parameter (a − b) as a function of depth, the extent of shallow creep, and the recurrence interval of large events.

Site ampliﬁcation correlates well with large peak ground velocities registered during the 2004 Parkﬁeld mainshock. The inversion for a kinematic rupture model yields a nonunique solution; we therefore analyze various rupture models that explain the data equally well. Our preferred rupture model identiﬁes a primary zone of high slip surrounding the hypocenter, where the maximum slip is 57 cm. A secondary slip area, over which contours are not well resolved, is located northwest of the hypocenter. The rupture speed is highly heterogeneous. We infer an average rupture velocity of ϳ2.8 km/sec close to the hypocenter, and of ϳ3.3 km/sec in the secondary region of large slip to the northwest of the hypocenter. By correlation of our rupture model with both microseismicity and velocity structure, we identify six patches on the fault plane that behave in seismically distinct ways.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"P."}],"citation-key":"Liu_2006_KinematicInversion","container-title":"Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America","container-title-short":"Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America","DOI":"10.1785/0120050826","ISSN":"0037-1106","issue":"4B","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"S143-S158","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Kinematic Inversion of the 2004 M 6.0 Parkfield Earthquake Including an Approximation to Site Effects","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/bssa/article/96/4B/S143-S158/146701","volume":"96"},

However, we recently found that the near-field postseismic transients after the two earthquakes have lasted longer than previously thought, which requires a revision of the postseismic modeling. Our new modeling results based on the revised postseismic transients show that: (1) the effective viscosity of the lower crust beneath the Mojave region at the decadal time scale is ∼2 × 1020 Pa·s (transient viscosity ∼2 × 1019 Pa·s), i.e., only ∼5 times that of the underlying mantle asthenosphere, and (2) the transient viscosity of the upper mantle exhibits a time-dependent increase, providing fresh geodetic evidence for frequency-dependent rheology (e.g., Andrade or extended Burgers rheology). The inferred transient rheology for the first year agrees well with that obtained for the July 2019 Mw 6.4 and Mw 7.1 Ridgecrest earthquakes ∼180 km north of the two Mojave events.

Specifically, the creep rate along the central SAF is shown to be directly proportional to the fraction of nonclustered earthquakes for the period 1984–2020. This relationship provides a unified perspective of earthquake phenomenology along the SAF, where lower coupling manifests in weaker temporal clustering, with repeating earthquakes as an end-member.

  {"id":"Lui.Lapusta_2018_ModelingHigh","abstract":"Repeating earthquake sequences have been actively investigated to clarify many aspects of earthquake physics. The two particularly well-studied sequences, known as the Los Angeles and San Francisco repeaters, have several intriguing observations, including their long (for the seismic moment) recurrence times that would suggest stress drops of 300 MPa based on typical assumptions, near-syncronized timing prior to 2004, and higher than typical inferred stress drops (of 25 to 65 MPa, up to 90 MPa locally), but not as high as the recurrence times suggest. Here we show that all these observations are self-consistent, in the sense that they can be reproduced in a single fault model. The suitable models build on the standard rate-and-state fault models, with velocity-weakening patches imbedded into a velocity-strengthening region, by adding either enhanced dynamic weakening during seismic slip or elevated normal stress on the patches, or both, to allow for the higher stress drops. Such models are able to match the observed average properties of the San Francisco and Los Angeles repeaters, as well as the overall nontrivial scaling between the recurrence time and seismic moment exhibited by many repeating sequences as a whole, for reasonable parameter choices based on experiments and theoretical studies. These models are characterized by the occurrence of substantial and variable aseismic slip at the locations of the repeating sources, which explains their atypical relation between recurrence interval and seismic moment, induces variability in the repeating source properties as observed, and results in their neither slip- nor time-predictable behavior.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Lui","given":"Semechah K.

  {"id":"Luo.Wang_2021_PostseismicGeodetic","abstract":"A sharp thermal contrast between the cold forearc and the hot arc and backarc is considered fundamental to various subduction-zone processes. However, direct observational evidence for this contrast is rather limited. If this contrast is present, it must cause a rheological contrast in the mantle wedge: elastic in the forearc and viscoelastic in the arc and backarc for the timescale of earthquake cycles. Here we demonstrate that postseismic deformation following large subduction earthquakes provides independent evidence for the thermally controlled rheological contrast. Specifically, we show that seaward postseismic motion is deflected upward at the edge of the cold forearc mantle wedge, causing diagnostic uplift just seaward of the volcanic arc. From numerical simulations of postseismic deformation following the 2011 moment magnitude (Mw) 9 Tohoku-oki, 2010 Mw 8.8 Maule, 2007 Mw 8.4 Bengkulu and 1960 Mw 9.5 Chile earthquakes, together with a global synthesis of postseismic uplift measurements, we find that cold forearc mantle is present irrespective of the diversity in tectonic settings. Our findings also indicate that field surveys eight years after the 1960 Chile earthquake provided some of the earliest evidence for viscoelastic postseismic deformation. We suggest that the established link between long-term thermal processes and short-term earthquake cycle deformation is important to understanding subduction-zone dynamics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Luo","given":"Haipeng"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Kelin"}],"citation-key":"Luo.Wang_2021_PostseismicGeodetic","container-title":"Nature Geoscience","container-title-short":"Nat.

Phase unwrapping (PU) errors have proven to be one of the main sources of bias that hinder achieving such high accuracy. In this article, a new time series PU approach is developed to improve the unwrapping accuracy. The rationale behind the proposed method is to ﬁrst improve the sparse unwrapping by mitigating the phase gradients in a 2-D network and then correcting the unwrapping errors in time, based on the triplet phase closure. Rather than the commonly used Delaunay network, we employ the all-pairs-shortest-path (APSP) algorithm from graph theory to maximize the temporal coherence of all edges and to approach the phase continuity assumption in the 2-D spatial domain. Next, we formulate the PU error correction in the 1-D temporal domain as compressed sensing (CS) problem, according to the sparsity of the remaining phase ambiguity cycles. We ﬁnally estimate phase ambiguity cycles by means of integer linear programming (ILP). The comprehensive comparisons using synthetic and real Sentinel-1 data covering Lost Hills, California, conﬁrm the validity of the proposed 2-D + 1-D unwrapping approach and its superior performance compared to previous methods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Ma","given":"Zhang-Feng"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Mi"},{"family":"Khoshmanesh","given":"Mostafa"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Xiao"}],"citation-key":"Ma.etal_2021_TimeSeries","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","container-title-short":"IEEE Trans.

Here we propose a workflow in a review way towards efficient and high-resolution Sentinel-1 NRT InSAR processing. In addition, we are committed to addressing issues that are often overlooked but indispensable in NRT data processing: co-registration and phase unwrapping. Through this workflow, not only NRT results in the radar Line-of-Sight (LOS) direction can be obtained, but also along-track NRT observations in overlap regions of images can be achieved. Unlike deriving LOS time series displacements which requires additional operations after co-registration, along-track displacements, a by-product of co-registration, can be directly obtained without further processing. We test and validate the proposed workflow in three regions with representative geomorphological processes including volcanic activity, city subsidence, and landslides. Experimental results demonstrate that our workflow can perform NRT monitoring at a relatively high resolution and a relatively low computational and storage “burden”.

To further improve measurement accuracy, here we propose a new time series BOI algorithm toward maximizing the performance of BOI and obtaining as high accuracy of the along-track deformations as possible. This algorithm has three major steps. The first step is to enhance BOI phase signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) using our newly proposed phase estimator. In the second step, we apply a strain model-based method to further suppress the phase noise and rescue more data points. In the third step, a misregistration correction procedure which considers plate motion is applied to mitigate BOI time series bias. We tested our proposed algorithm over the Chaman fault.

  {"id":"Mallick.Simons_2023_LimitsInferring","abstract":"The relationship between stress and deformation of the solid Earth, at various temporal and spatial scales, can be described using a variety of constitutive relations. While our knowledge of the elastic component of these constitutive relations is well constrained by seismological observations, there are limited opportunities to probe the inelastic component of plausible constitutive relations. Focusing on viscoelastic rheologies, the exact formulation of the viscous component of the rheology of the crust-mantle system is not uniquely constrained i.e., multiple formulations (linear Burgers and power-law) are able to recreate geodetic observations of the earthquake cycle. Here, we show that it is possible to discriminate between these commonly adopted rheological models under certain conditions, even with the limited observational time span of geodetic networks. We first run a set of numerical simulations of periodic earthquake cycles as well as 2-event sequences for a 2-D strike-slip fault in a frictional-viscoelastic medium using \\textit{realistic} rheological parameter choices, and then predict the resulting surface displacement time series over a 20-year time window. We invert the synthetic surface displacements to obtain best-fit parameters for a simplified boundary element representation of each rheological model and compare the misfits. Linear Burgers and power-law rheologies are nearly indistinguishable when considering periodic events, but they can be distinguished using data from earthquake sequences when events are sufficiently different in magnitude and occur with adequate temporal separation. However, when the \\textit{true} parameters represent a power-law rheology, it is not possible to uniquely recover all the rheological parameters.","author":[{"family":"Mallick","given":"Rishav"},{"family":"Simons","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"Mallick.Simons_2023_LimitsInferring","DOI":"10.13140/RG.2.2.18028.74880","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,11]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"Limits on inferring an effective lithospheric rheology from geodetic observations of the earthquake cycle","type":"article"},

In this paper, we study surface displacements due to magma chamber inﬂation, using heterogeneous ﬁnite element models. We ﬁrst present a systematic analysis of the inﬂuence of mechanical layering, showing that the stiffness contrast signiﬁcantly affects the entity and the pattern of vertical and radial displacements. Second, as an example we apply the models to interpret ground displacements at Darwin volcano (Gala´pagos Islands) as revealed by InSAR data in the period 1992–1998. The considered models suggest that geodetic data interpreted using homogeneous models leads to underestimation of the source depth and volume change. Thus, we propose correction factors for the source parameters estimated by homogeneous models, in order to consider a range of variation due to mechanical layering as analysed in this study. The effect of the mechanical heterogeneities affects the correct understanding of geodetic data and also inﬂuences the evaluation of a volcanic hazard potential.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Manconi","given":"A."},{"family":"Walter","given":"T.

  {"id":"Mao.etal_2021_EstimationCompensation","abstract":"Multiple aperture interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MAI) can measure ground displacements along SAR track. However, MAI measurements may suffer from severe ionospheric error, especially for long-wavelength SAR sensors. This study presents a new approach, azimuth split-spectrum interferometry (AziSSI), to correct ionospheric errors in MAI measurements. The proposed method can straightforwardly resolve ionospheric phase delay by exploiting two subband MAI interferograms with different centroid frequencies. We utilized two groups of ALOS-1 PALSAR images, which cover the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake containing strong coseismic ground deformation and a stable coast region in Chile, respectively, to test the proposed method. Experimental results show that the AziSSI method can successfully recover the coseismic displacements induced by the Wenchuan earthquake and circumvent the azimuth stripes for the Chile case's MAI measurements. The maximum ionosphere-induced azimuth shifts are about 2.2 m for the Wenchuan case and 2.5 m for the Chile case. We validated the correction performance of the AziSSI method with the Wenchuan case by comparing the compensated azimuth displacements with the simulated deformation from a forward fault slip model and coseismic global positioning system (GPS) measurements. The validations show that the deformation patterns after the ionospheric correction are consistent with the simulations of the sinistral slip of the causative fault. The root-mean-square error between the GPS and MAI measurements is reduced from 0.77 to 0.28 m before and after the ionospheric correction, indicating that AziSSI can significantly compensate ionospheric errors for MAI.","author":[{"family":"Mao","given":"Wenfei"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiaowen"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Guoxiang"},{"literal":"Rui Zhang"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Rui"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Yueling"},{"family":"Pirasteh","given":"Saied"}],"citation-key":"Mao.etal_2021_EstimationCompensation","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","DOI":"10.1109/tgrs.2021.3095272","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,26]]},"note":"ZSCC:00000\nMAG ID: 3189529875\nS2ID: eca71a7170538418987cf85462a95c621d70b9ad","title":"Estimation and Compensation of Ionospheric Phase Delay for Multi-Aperture InSAR: An Azimuth Split-Spectrum Interferometry Approach","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"Marconato.etal_2022_InsightsFault","abstract":"The 2019, Mw 4.9 Le Teil earthquake occurred in southeastern France, causing substantial damage in this slow deforming region. Field observations, remote sensing and seismological studies following the event revealed that coseismic slip concentrates at shallow depth along a ∼5 km long rupture associated with surface breaks and a thrusting mechanism. We further investigate this earthquake by combining geological field mapping, 3-D geology, InSAR time-series analysis and a coseismic slip inversion. From structural, stratigraphic and geological data collected around the epicentre, we first produce a 3-D geological model of the region surrounding the rupture using the GeoModeller software. Our model includes the geometry of the geological layers and the main faults, including the La Rouvière Fault, (LRF) the Oligocene normal fault that ruptured during the earthquake. We generate a time-series of surface displacement from Sentinel-1 SAR data ranging from early 2019 January to late 2020 January using the NSBAS processing chain. The spatio-temporal patterns of surface displacement for this time span show neither a clear pre-seismic signal nor significant post-seismic transient deformation. We extract the coseismic displacement pattern from the InSAR time-series, highlighting along-strike variations of coseismic surface slip. The maximum relative displacement along the line of sight is up to ∼16 cm and is located in the southwestern part of the rupture. We invert for the slip distribution on the fault from the InSAR coseismic surface displacement field. Constraining our fault geometry from the geological model, acceptable fault dip ranges between 55° and 60°. Our model confirms the reactivation of LRF, with reverse slip at very shallow depth and two main slip patches reaching, respectively, 30 and 24 cm of slip, both around 500 m depth. We finally discuss how the 3-D fault geometry and geological structure may have impacted the slip distribution and propagation during the earthquake. This study is a step to reassess the seismic hazard of the many faults similar to the La Rouvière one along the Cévennes fault system, in a densely populated area hosting several sensitive nuclear sites.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Marconato","given":"L"},{"family":"Leloup","given":"P H"},{"family":"Lasserre","given":"C"},{"family":"Jolivet","given":"R"},{"family":"Caritg","given":"S"},{"family":"Grandin","given":"R"},{"family":"Métois","given":"M"},{"family":"Cavalié","given":"O"},{"family":"Audin","given":"L"}],"citation-key":"Marconato.etal_2022_InsightsFault","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","container-title-short":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1093/gji/ggab498","ISSN":"0956-540X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,1]]},"page":"758-775","source":"Silverchair","title":"Insights on fault reactivation during the 2019 November 11, Mw 4.9 Le Teil earthquake in southeastern France, from a joint 3-D geological model and InSAR time-series analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggab498","volume":"229"},

In addition, transient loading can be caused by aseismic deformation episodes, for example during crustal fluid migration or slow slip events. These forcing transients are best revealed by geodetic measurements. However, this type of instrumentation is not always available, or is not always sensitive enough to detect significant anomalies. In such cases, one is better off exploiting the seismicity signature of these transients in order to characterize them. We here explore different ways to do so.

This is achieved by not permitting an earthquake to have a seismic moment greater than the current seismic moment deficit. This causes the Gutenberg–Richter law to be modulated by a smooth upper cutoff, the location of which can be predicted from the model parameters. We investigate the various regimes of this model that more particularly include a regime in which the activity does not die off even with a vanishingly small spontaneous (i.e., background) earthquake rate and one that bears strong statistical similarities with repeating earthquake time series. Finally, this model relates the earthquake rate and the geodetic moment rate and, therefore, allows to make sense of this relationship in terms of fundamental empirical law (the Gutenberg–Richter law, the productivity law, and the Omori law) and physical parameters (seismic coupling, tectonic loading rate).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Marsan","given":"David"},{"family":"Tan","given":"Yen Joe"}],"citation-key":"Marsan.Tan_2020_MaximumEarthquake","container-title":"Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America","container-title-short":"Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America","DOI":"10.1785/0120190196","ISSN":"0037-1106","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",3,3]]},"page":"874-885","source":"Silverchair","title":"Maximum Earthquake Size and Seismicity Rate from an ETAS Model with Slip Budget","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1785/0120190196","volume":"110"},

Harmonic coefﬁcients are extracted from up to 14 yr of GPS-inferred receiver locations, which we estimate at 5 min intervals using precise point positioning. We compare the observed OTL-induced surface displacements against predictions derived from spherically symmetric, non-rotating, elastic and isotropic (SNREI) Earth models. We also compare sets of modelled predictions directly for various ocean-tide and Earth-model combinations. The vector differences between predicted displacements computed using separate ocean-tide models reveal uniform-displacement components common to all stations in the South America network. Removal of the network-mean OTL-induced displacements from each site substantially reduces the vector differences between observed and predicted displacements. We focus on the dominant astronomical tidal harmonics from three distinct frequency bands: semidiurnal (M2), diurnal (O1) and fortnightly (Mf). In each band, the observed OTL-induced surface displacements strongly resemble the modelled displacement-response patterns, and the residuals agree to about 0.3 mm or better. Even with the submillimetre correspondence between observations and predictions, we detect regional-scale spatial coherency in the ﬁnal set of residuals, most notably for the M2 harmonic. The spatial coherency appears relatively insensitive to the speciﬁc choice of ocean-tide or SNREI-Earth model. Varying the load model or 1-D elastic structure yields predicted OTL-induced displacement differences of order 0.1 mm or less for the network. Furthermore, estimates of the observational uncertainty place the noise level below the magnitude of the residual displacements for most stations, supporting our interpretation that random errors cannot account for the entire misﬁt. Therefore, the spatially coherent residuals may reveal deﬁciencies in the a priori SNREI Earth models. In particular, the residuals may indicate sensitivity to regional deviations from standard globally averaged Earth structure due to the presence of the South American craton.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Martens","given":"Hilary R."},{"family":"Simons","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Owen","given":"Susan"},{"family":"Rivera","given":"Luis"}],"citation-key":"Martens.etal_2016_ObservationsOcean","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","container-title-short":"Geophys.

Pertinent applications include hydrology, glaciology, geodynamics, atmospheric science, and climatology. To address the diversity of emerging applications, we introduce a software suite called LoadDef that provides a collection of modular functions for modeling planetary deformation within a self-consistent, Python-based computational framework. Key features of LoadDef include computation of real-valued potential, load, and shear Love numbers for self-gravitating and spherically symmetric planetary models; computation of Love-number partial derivatives with respect to planetary density and elastic structure; computation of displacement, gravity, tilt, and strain load Green's functions; and computation of three-component surface displacements induced by surface mass loading. At a most basic level, only a planetary-structure model and a mass-load model must be supplied as input to LoadDef to utilize all the main features of the software. The end-to-end forward-modeling capabilities for mass-loading applications lay the foundation for sensitivity studies and geodetic tomography.

Here we present a detailed examination of load-induced surface displacements and their sensitivities to systematic perturbations in elastic Earth structure. We compute Love numbers and displacement load Green’s functions (LGFs) by integrating the equations of motion for spheroidal deformation of a radially heterogeneous and self-gravitating Earth. Sensitivity kernels are derived for individual Love numbers numerically using ﬁnite diﬀerences and quasi-analytically using calculus of variations. We then generate sensitivity kernels for displacement LGFs by systematically perturbing the preliminary reference Earth model. We ﬁnd that displacement LGFs are most sensitive to elastic structural perturbations within 500 km depth from the surface and for short source-receiver distances. For separate perturbations to the shear modulus, bulk modulus, and density within the crust and mantle, the sensitivity kernels exhibit unique patterns, consistent with the possibility to constrain the parameters independently given a spatially distributed set of suﬃciently accurate loading response observations. The sensitivity to density structure, however, is generally weak in comparison to elastic structure. We also examine the sensitivity of surface displacements caused by M2 ocean tidal loading (OTL) to systematic perturbations in the elastic moduli and density. Since OTL-induced surface displacements are load and site dependent, we focus on high-resolution proﬁles across Iceland as a case study.

GPS-inferred surface displacements recorded by the Plate Boundary Observatory network are compared with predictions of deformation associated with the redistribution of ocean water due to the tides. We process more than 5 yr of GPS data from 131 stations using a kinematic precise point positioning algorithm and estimate tidal contributions using harmonic analysis. We also forward calculate load-induced surface displacements by convolving ocean-tide models with load Green’s functions derived from spherically symmetric Earth models. We make the comparisons for dominant tidal harmonics in three frequency bands: semidiurnal (M2), diurnal (O1) and fortnightly (Mf). Vector differences between predicted and observed ocean tidal loading (OTL) displacements are predominantly sub-mm in magnitude in all three frequency bands and spatial components across the network, with larger residuals of up to several mm in some coastal areas. Accounting for the effects of anelastic dispersion in the upper mantle using estimates of Q from standard Earth models reduces the residuals for the M2 harmonic by an average of 0.1–0.2 mm across the network and by more than 1 mm at some individual stations. For the relatively small Mf tide, the effects of anelastic dispersion (<0.03 mm) are undetectable within current measurement error. Incorporating a local ocean-tide model for the northeastern Paciﬁc Ocean reduces the M2 vertical residuals by an average of 0.2 mm, with improvements of up to 5 mm at some coastal stations. Estimated RMS observational uncertainties in the vertical component for the M2 and O1 tides are approximately ±0.08 mm at the two-sigma level (±0.03 mm in the horizontal components), and ±0.21 mm for the Mf harmonic (±0.07 mm in the horizontal components). For the M2 harmonic, discrepancies between predicted and observed OTL displacements exceed observational uncertainties by about one order of magnitude. None of the ocean tide and Earth model combinations is found to reduce the M2 residuals below the observational uncertainty, and no single forward model provides a best ﬁt to the observed displacements across all tidal harmonics and spatial components. For the O1 harmonic, discrepancies between predicted and observed displacements are generally several-fold larger than the observational uncertainties. For the Mf harmonic, the discrepancies are roughly within a factor of two of the observational uncertainties. We ﬁnd that discrepancies between predicted and observed OTL displacements can be signiﬁcantly reduced by removing a network-uniform tidal-harmonic displacement, and that the remaining discrepancies exhibit some regional-scale spatial coherency, particularly for the M2 harmonic. We suggest that the remaining discrepancies for the M2, O1 and Mf tides cannot be fully explained by measurement error and instead convey information about deﬁciencies in ocean-tide models and deviations from spherically symmetric Earth structure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Martens","given":"H R"},{"family":"Simons","given":"M"}],"citation-key":"Martens.Simons_2020_ComparisonPredicted","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1093/gji/ggaa323","ISSN":"0956-540X, 1365-246X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"454-470","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A comparison of predicted and observed ocean tidal loading in Alaska","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/223/1/454/5863947","volume":"223"},

  {"id":"Masterlark.etal_2016_VolcanoDeformation","abstract":"The eruption cycle of a volcano is controlled in part by the upward migration of magma. The characteristics of the magma ﬂux produce a deformation signature at the Earth’s surface. Inverse analyses use geodetic data to estimate strategic controlling parameters that describe the position and pressurization of a magma chamber at depth. The speciﬁc distribution of material properties controls how observed surface deformation translates to source parameter estimates. Seismic tomography models describe the spatial distributions of material properties that are necessary for accurate models of volcano deformation. This study investigates how uncertainties in seismic tomography models propagate into variations in the estimates of volcano deformation source parameters inverted from geodetic data. We conduct ﬁnite element model-based nonlinear inverse analyses of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data for Okmok volcano, Alaska, as an example. We then analyze the estimated parameters and their uncertainties to characterize the magma chamber. Analyses are performed separately for models simulating a pressurized chamber embedded in a homogeneous domain as well as for a domain having a heterogeneous distribution of material properties according to seismic tomography. The estimated depth of the source is sensitive to the distribution of material properties. The estimated depths for the homogeneous and heterogeneous domains are 2666 ± 42 and 3527 ± 56 m below mean sea level, respectively (99% conﬁdence). A Monte Carlo analysis indicates that uncertainties of the seismic tomography cannot account for this discrepancy at the 99% conﬁdence level. Accounting for the spatial distribution of elastic properties according to seismic tomography signiﬁcantly improves the ﬁt of the deformation model predictions and signiﬁcantly inﬂuences estimates for parameters that describe the location of a pressurized magma chamber.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Masterlark","given":"Timothy"},{"family":"Donovan","given":"Theodore"},{"family":"Feigl","given":"Kurt L."},{"family":"Haney","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Thurber","given":"Clifford H."},{"family":"Tung","given":"Sui"}],"citation-key":"Masterlark.etal_2016_VolcanoDeformation","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","container-title-short":"J.

An earthquake swarm near the geothermal field in 2012 included two earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 5 and was potentially preceded by a years-long aseismic slip transient. To better understand ground deformation around the geothermal field, including its evolution with time and its physical mechanisms, we analyze deformation before, during, and after the swarm using ground- and satellite-based geodetic techniques between 2009 and 2019. We integrate observations from GNSS, Sentinel-1, TerraSAR-X, UAVSAR, and leveling surveys into a single deformation history. Modeling of this new collection of observations at the North Brawley Geothermal Field provides evidence for 80% more pre-swarm aseismic slip than previously recognized from 2009 to 2012. During the 2012 Brawley swarm, our geodetic slip inversions closely match the results of seismic waveform inversions from the swarm events. After the 2012 swarm, surface deformation is dominated by poroelastic deformation of a shallow fluid reservoir at <1 km depth rather than fault slip. The deformation history and seismicity catalogs at North Brawley suggest a cessation of fault-related slip during the ∼7 years after the 2012 earthquake swarm.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Materna","given":"Kathryn"},{"family":"Barbour","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Jiang","given":"Junle"},{"family":"Eneva","given":"Mariana"}],"citation-key":"Materna.etal_2022_DetectionAseismic","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/2021JB023335","ISSN":"2169-9356","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2022 American Geophysical Union.

In this study, we focus on the 2017–2018 slow slip event (SSE) in the Guerrero state (Mexico) where (1) the permanent GPS network has a low spatial density (less than 30 stations in an area of 300 300 km) with uneven distribution; (2) the tropospheric phase delays can be as high as 20 cm of apparent ground displacements, with a complex temporal evolution; (3) the tested global weather models fail to correct interferograms with enough accuracy (with residual tropospheric signal higher than the tectonic signal); and (4) the surface displacement caused by the seismic cycle shows complex interactions between seismic sequences and aseismic events. To extract the SSE signal from Sentinel-1 InSAR time series, we test two different approaches. The first (parametric method) consists of a least squares linear inversion, imposing a functional form for each deformation or atmospheric component. The second uses independent component analysis of the InSAR time series. We obtain time series maps of surface displacements along the radar line of sight associated with the SSE and validate these results with a comparison to GPS. Combining those two approaches, we propose a method to separate atmospheric delays and tectonic deformation on time series data not corrected from atmospheric delays. From the extracted ground deformation maps, we propose a first-order slip inversion model at the subduction interface during this SSE.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Maubant","given":"L."},{"family":"Pathier","given":"E."},{"family":"Daout","given":"S."},{"family":"Radiguet","given":"M."},{"family":"Doin","given":"M.-P."},{"family":"Kazachkina","given":"E."},{"family":"Kostoglodov","given":"V."},{"family":"Cotte","given":"N."},{"family":"Walpersdorf","given":"A."}],"citation-key":"Maubant.etal_2020_IndependentComponent","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/2019JB018187","ISSN":"2169-9356","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC:00024","page":"e2019JB018187","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Independent Component Analysis and Parametric Approach for Source Separation in InSAR Time Series at Regional Scale: Application to the 2017–2018 Slow Slip Event in Guerrero (Mexico)","title-short":"Independent Component Analysis and Parametric Approach for Source Separation in InSAR Time Series at Regional Scale","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019JB018187","volume":"125"},
  {"id":"Maurer.Johnson_2014_FaultCoupling","abstract":"The 150 km long central section of the San Andreas Fault (CSAF) in central California creeps at the surface and has not produced a large earthquake historically. However, sections of the San Andreas Fault to the north and south are known to have ruptured repeatedly in M~7–8 earthquakes. It is currently unclear whether the creeping CSAF could rupture in large earthquakes, either individually or along with earthquakes on the locked sections to the north and south. We invert Global Positioning System and interferometric synthetic aperture radar data with elastic block models to estimate the degree of locking on the CSAF and place bounds on the moment accumulation rate on the fault. We ﬁnd that the inferred moment accumulation rate is highly dependent on the long-term fault slip rate, which is poorly constrained along the CSAF. The inferred moment accumulation rate, normalized by shear modulus, ranges from 3.28 × 104 to 5.85 × 107 m3/yr, which is equivalent to a Mw = 5.5–7.2 earthquake every 150 years for a long-term slip rate of 26 mm/yr and Mw = 7.3–7.65 for a long-term slip rate of 34 mm/yr.

We present a well-constrained Eurasia–Nubia Euler vector derived from 23 IGS sites in Europe and four CGPS and three SGPS sites on the Nubian Plate (−0.95 ± 4.8◦N, −21.8 ± 4.3◦E, 0.06 ± 0.005◦ Myr−1). We see no signiﬁcant (> 1 mm yr−1) internal deformation of the Nubian Plate. The GPS Nubian–Eurasian Euler vector differs signiﬁcantly from NUVEL-1A (21.0 ± 4.2◦N, −20.6 ± 0.6◦E, 0.12 ± 0.015◦ Myr−1), implying more westward motion of Africa relative to Eurasia and slower convergence in the eastern Mediterranean. The Arabia–Eurasia and Arabia–Nubia GPS Euler vectors are less well determined, based on only one CGPS and three SGPS sites on the Arabian Plate. The preliminary Arabia–Eurasia and Arabia–Nubia Euler vectors are 27.4 ± 1.0◦N, 18.4 ± 2.5◦E, 0.40 ± 0.04◦ Myr−1, and 30.5 ± 1.0◦N, 25.7 ± 2.3◦E, 0.37 ± 0.04◦ Myr−1, respectively. The GPS Arabia–Nubia Euler vector differs signiﬁcantly from NUVEL-1A (24.1 ± 1.7◦N, 24.0 ± 3.5◦E, 0.40 ± 0.05◦ Myr−1), but is statistically consistent at the 95 per cent conﬁdence level with the revised Euler vector reported by Chu & Gordon based on a re-evaluation of magnetic anomalies in the Red Sea (31.5 ± 1.2◦N, 23.0 ± 2.7◦E, 0.40 ± 0.05◦ Myr−1). The motion implied in the Gulf of Aqaba and on the Dead Sea fault (DSF) by the new GPS Nubia–Arabia Euler vector (i.e. ignoring possible Sinai block motion and possible internal plate deformation) grades from pure left lateral strike-slip in the Gulf and on the southern DSF with increasing compression on the central and northern DSF with relative motion increasing from 5.6 to 7.5 mm yr−1 (±1 mm yr−1) from south to north. Along the northern DSF (i.e. north of the Lebanon restraining bend) motion is partitioned between 6 ± 1 mm yr−1 left-lateral motion parallel to the fault trace and 4 ± 1 mm yr−1 faultnormal compression. Relative motions on other plate boundaries (including the Anatolian and Aegean microplates) derived from the GPS Euler vectors agree qualitatively with the sense of motion indicated by focal mechanisms for large crustal earthquakes (M > 6). Where data are available on fault-slip rates on plate bounding faults (North Anatolian fault, East Anatolian fault, Dead Sea fault, Red Sea rift), they are generally lower than, but not signiﬁcantly different from, the full plate motion estimates suggesting that the majority of relative plate motion is accommodated on these structures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"McClusky","given":"S."},{"family":"Reilinger","given":"R."},{"family":"Mahmoud","given":"S."},{"family":"Ben Sari","given":"D."},{"family":"Tealeb","given":"A."}],"citation-key":"McClusky.etal_2003_GPSConstraints","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1046/j.1365-246X.2003.02023.x","ISSN":"0956540X, 1365246X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",10]]},"language":"en","page":"126-138","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"GPS constraints on Africa (Nubia) and Arabia plate motions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/gji/article-lookup/doi/10.1046/j.1365-246X.2003.02023.x","volume":"155"},

  {"id":"Mechie.etal_2009_CrustalStructure","abstract":"As part of the DEad Sea Integrated REsearch project (DESIRE) a 235 km long seismic wide-angle reflection/refraction (WRR) profile was completed in spring 2006 across the Dead Sea Transform (DST) in the region of the southern Dead Sea basin (DSB). The DST with a total of about 107 km multi-stage left-lateral shear since about 18 Ma ago, accommodates the movement between the Arabian and African plates. It connects the spreading centre in the Red Sea with the Taurus collision zone in Turkey over a length of about 1 100 km. With a sedimentary infill of about 10 km in places, the southern DSB is the largest pull-apart basin along the DST and one of the largest pull-apart basins on Earth. The WRR measurements comprised 11 shots recorded by 200 three-component and 400 one-component instruments spaced 300 m to 1.2 km apart along the whole length of the E-W trending profile. Models of the P-wave velocity structure derived from the WRR data show that the sedimentary infill associated with the formation of the southern DSB is about 8.5 km thick beneath the profile. With around an additional 2 km of older sediments, the depth to the seismic basement beneath the southern DSB is about 11 km below sea level beneath the profile. Seismic refraction data from an earlier experiment suggest that the seismic basement continues to deepen to a maximum depth of about 14 km, about 10 km south of the DESIRE profile. In contrast, the interfaces below about 20 km depth, including the top of the lower crust and the Moho, probably show less than 3 km variation in depth beneath the profile as it crosses the southern DSB. Thus the Dead Sea pull-apart basin may be essentially an upper crustal feature with upper crustal extension associated with the left-lateral motion along the DST. The boundary between the upper and lower crust at about 20 km depth might act as a decoupling zone. Below this boundary the two plates move past each other in what is essentially a shearing motion. Thermo-mechanical modelling of the DSB supports such a scenario. As the DESIRE seismic profile crosses the DST about 100 km north of where the DESERT seismic profile crosses the DST, it has been possible to construct a crustal cross-section of the region before the 107 km left-lateral shear on the DST occurred.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Mechie","given":"J."},{"family":"Abu-Ayyash","given":"K."},{"family":"Ben-Avraham","given":"Z."},{"family":"El-Kelani","given":"R."},{"family":"Qabbani","given":"I."},{"family":"Weber","given":"M."},{"literal":"DESIRE Group"}],"citation-key":"Mechie.etal_2009_CrustalStructure","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","container-title-short":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2009.04161.x","ISSN":"0956-540X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",7,1]]},"note":"ZSCC:00065","page":"457-478","source":"Silverchair","title":"Crustal structure of the southern Dead Sea basin derived from project DESIRE wide-angle seismic data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2009.04161.x","volume":"178"},

This question of fundamental scientific and practical importance has recently been addressed by studies of teleseismic source time functions (STFs) but reaching contrasting conclusions. One study concludes that the initial portion of STFs is the same regardless of magnitude. Another study concludes that the rate at which earthquakes grow increases systematically and strongly with final event magnitudes. Here, we show that the latter reported trend is caused by a selection bias towards events with unusually long durations and by estimates of STF growth made when the STF is already decaying. If these invalid estimates are left out, the trend is no longer present, except during the first few seconds of the smallest events in the data set, Mw 5–6.5, for which the reliability of the STF amplitudes is questionable. Simple synthetic tests show that the observations are consistent with statistically indistinguishable growth of smaller and larger earthquakes. A much weaker trend is apparent among events of comparable duration, but we argue that its significance is not resolvable by the current data. Finally, we propose a nomenclature to facilitate further discussions of earthquake rupture predictability and determinism.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Meier","given":"Men-Andrin"},{"family":"Ampuero","given":"Jean-Paul"},{"family":"Cochran","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Page","given":"Morgan"}],"citation-key":"Meier.etal_2021_ApparentEarthquake","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","container-title-short":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1093/gji/ggaa610","ISSN":"0956-540X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,14]]},"page":"657-663","source":"Silverchair","title":"Apparent earthquake rupture predictability","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggaa610","volume":"225"},

  {"id":"Menzies.etal_2016_FluidBudget","abstract":"Fluids play a key role in modifying the chemical and physical properties of fault zones, which may prime them for repeated rupture by the generation of high pore fluid pressures and precipitation of commonly weak, secondary minerals. Fluid flow paths, sources and fluxes, and the permeability evolution of fault zones throughout their seismic cycles remain poorly constrained, despite their importance to understanding fault zone behaviour. Here we use geochemical tracers of fluid–rock exchange to determine budgets for meteoric, metamorphic and mantle fluids on a major compressional tectonic plate boundary. The Alpine Fault marks the transpressional Pacific–Australian plate boundary through South Island, New Zealand and appears to fail in regular (329±68 yrs) large earthquakes (Mw∼8) with the most recent event in 1717 AD. Significant convergent motion has formed the Southern Alps and elevated geothermal gradients in the hangingwall, which drive crustal fluid flow. Along the Alpine Fault the Alpine Schist of the Pacific Plate is thrust over radiogenic metasedimentary rocks on the Australian plate. The absence of highly radiogenic (87Sr/86Sr > 0.7200) strontium isotope ratios of hangingwall hot springs and hydrothermal minerals formed at a range of depths in the Alpine Fault damage zone indicates that the fluid flow is restricted to the hangingwall by a cross-fault fluid flow barrier throughout the seismogenic crust. Helium isotope ratios measured in hot springs near to the Alpine Fault (0.15–0.81 RA) indicate the fault is a crustal-scale feature that acts as a conduit for fluids from the mantle. Rock-exchanged oxygen, but meteoric water-like hydrogen isotope signatures of hydrothermal veins indicate that partially rock-exchanged meteoric fluids dominate down to the top of the brittle to ductile transition zone at ∼6 km. Geochemical tracer transport modelling suggests only ∼0.02 to 0.05% of total rainfall west of the Main Divide penetrates to depth, yet this recharge flux is sufficient to overwhelm other fluid contributions. Calculated mantle fluid fluxes of CO2 and H2O (0.2 and 3 to 13 mol/m2/yr respectively) and metamorphic H2O fluxes (4 to 750 mol/m2/yr) are considerably lower than the focused meteoric water discharge flux up the Alpine Fault (4 × 103 to 7 × 104 mol/m2/yr), driven by the >3000 m hydrologic head of the Southern Alps. Meteoric waters are primarily responsible for modifying fault zone permeability during fluid–rock interactions and may facilitate the generation of high pore fluid pressures that could assist episodic earthquake rupture.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Menzies","given":"Catriona D."},{"family":"Teagle","given":"Damon A.

We compare the moment released by the known earthquakes and associated postseismic deformation with the moment deficit accumulated during the interseismic period derived from geodetic measurement of interseismic strain. We find that the recurring Mw 6 earthquakes are insufficient to balance the slip budget. We discuss and evaluate various possible scenarios which might account for the residual moment deficit and implications of the possible magnitude and return period of Mw > 6 earthquakes on that fault segment. The most likely explanation is that this fault segment hosts Mw 6.5–7.5 earthquakes, with a return period of 140–300 yrs. Such events could happen as independent earthquakes in conjunction with ruptures of the Carrizo plain segment of the SAF.

First, we use the secular linear motion to determine interseismic locking along the megathrust. We determine two end member models, assuming that the megathrust is either a priori locked or creeping, which differ essentially along the trench where the inversion is poorly constrained by the data. In either case, significant locking of the megathrust updip of the coastline is needed. The downdip limit of the locked portion lies ∼ 20–80 km updip from the coast assuming a locked a priori, but very close to the coast for a creeping a priori. Second, we use a variational Bayesian Independent Component Analysis (vbICA) decomposition to model geodetic strain time variations, an approach which is effective to separate the geodetic strain signal due to non-tectonic and tectonic sources. The Slow Slip Events (SSEs) kinematics is retrieved by linearly inverting for slip on the megathrust the Independent Components related to these transient phenomena. The procedure allows the detection and modelling of 64 SSEs which spatially and temporally match with the tremors activity. SEEs and tremors occur well inland from the coastline and follow closely the estimated location of the mantle wedge corner. The transition zone, between the locked portion of the megathrust and the zone of tremors, is creeping rather steadily at the long-term slip rate and probably buffers the effect of SSEs on the megathrust seismogenic portion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Michel","given":"Sylvain"},{"family":"Gualandi","given":"Adriano"},{"family":"Avouac","given":"Jean-Philippe"}],"citation-key":"Michel.etal_2019_InterseismicCoupling","container-title":"Pure and Applied Geophysics","container-title-short":"Pure Appl.

Thanks to a new catalogue of slow-slip events on the Cascadia megathrust based on the inversion of surface deformation measurements between 2007 and 201715, we find that a cubic moment–duration scaling law is more likely. Like regular earthquakes, slow-slip events also have a moment that is proportional to A3/2, where A is the rupture area, and obey the Gutenberg–Richter relationship between frequency and magnitude. Finally, these slow-slip events show pulse-like ruptures similar to seismic ruptures. The scaling properties of slow-slip events are thus strikingly similar to those of regular earthquakes, suggesting that they are governed by similar dynamic properties.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Michel","given":"Sylvain"},{"family":"Gualandi","given":"Adriano"},{"family":"Avouac","given":"Jean-Philippe"}],"citation-key":"Michel.etal_2019_SimilarScaling","container-title":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-019-1673-6","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7779","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",10]]},"language":"en","license":"2019 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited","note":"ZSCC:00087","number":"7779","page":"522-526","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Similar scaling laws for earthquakes and Cascadia slow-slip events","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1673-6","volume":"574"},

The precision of the interferometric ice velocities is 1.8 cm d-1 (6 m a-1) (1σ). The phase correlation method measures ice velocity with a precision of 14 cm d-1 (50 m a-1) with image data at a 6 m sample spacing acquired 1 day apart. Averaged strain rates are measured with a precision of 10-4 d-1 at a 240 m sample spacing with the phase correlation method, and 10-5 d-l with radar interferometry. The phase correlation method is less precise than radar interferometry, but it performs better in areas of rapid flow, is more robust to temporal changes in glacier scattering and measures the glacier velocity in two dimensions with only one image pair. Using this technique, we find that Glaciar Moreno flows at 400 m a-1 in the terminal valley and 800 m a-1 at the calving front, in agreement with velocities recorded a decade ago.

It helps to understand the mode and origin of caldera collapses in basaltic volcanoes. Field observations, GPS and seismic data show that the collapse occurred at an early stage of the eruption.

  {"id":"Michon.etal_2009_HowSummit","abstract":"In April 2007, Piton de la Fournaise volcano experienced a caldera collapse during its largest historical eruption. We present here a structural analysis both of the caldera and the surrounding area, and precise GPS data recorded with a dense GPS network speciﬁcally dedicated to the analysis of deformation related to the summit collapse structures. Despite a collapse of more than 300 m in the central zone, the geometry of the new caldera is similar in map view to that of the pre-existing collapsed structure, which was formed from the coalescence of several pit craters. The caldera shows an asymmetric inner geometry with sub-vertical walls in the NW quadrant and steep scarps composed of inward tilted blocks in the southern half. The presence of preserved polished surfaces on the lower part of the sub-vertical scarp indicates that it corresponds to the caldera north-western ring fault. The April 2007 caldera collapse led to the development and the reactivation of concentric fractures on the caldera rim, mostly along the southern limit of the caldera. GPS data show that fractures result from radial extensional stresses that are restricted within the ﬁrst tens of meters of the caldera edge. GPS data also reveal that the caldera collapse was coeval with a centripetal deﬂation, whose magnitude is largest along the southern half of the caldera. The displacements recorded by GPS result from both a general deﬂation, due to magma withdrawal from Piton de la Fournaise's summit magma chamber, and additional local effects related to the caldera collapse. Comparison of the caldera collapses at Piton de la Fournaise, Miyakejima and Fernandina reveals striking similarities, with cyclic seismic signals accompanying small-scale deﬂation–inﬂation cycles. This strongly suggests a common mode of collapse. Hence, we propose a unifying model of caldera collapse in basaltic setting, in which the inward deﬂation due to magma withdrawal from the magma chamber prevents the collapse of the caldera roof until the gravitational stress acting on the rock column above the magma chamber exceeds the shear strength along pre-existing ring faults. The downward displacement stops when the pressure increase into the magma chamber is able to again sustain the rock column. The succession of (1) inward deﬂation that prevents the collapse, (2) collapse due to gravitational stress and (3) stopping of the downward motion is repeated many times. The frequency of the cycles is inﬂuenced by the rate of magma withdrawal and by the amount of intrusion of magma along the ring faults.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Michon","given":"Laurent"},{"family":"Villeneuve","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Catry","given":"Thibault"},{"family":"Merle","given":"Olivier"}],"citation-key":"Michon.etal_2009_HowSummit","container-title":"Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research","DOI":"10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2008.11.003","ISSN":"03770273","issue":"1-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",7]]},"language":"en","page":"138-151","source":"CrossRef","title":"How summit calderas collapse on basaltic volcanoes: New insights from the April 2007 caldera collapse of Piton de la Fournaise volcano","title-short":"How summit calderas collapse on basaltic volcanoes","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S037702730800591X","volume":"184"},

Earthquake prediction, the Grail of Seismology, is, in this context of continuous exciting discoveries, an obvious choice for deep learning exploration. We reviewed the literature of artificial neural network (ANN) applications for earthquake prediction (77 articles, 1994–2019 period) and found two emerging trends: an increasing interest in this domain over time and a complexification of ANN models toward deep learning. Despite the relatively positive results claimed in those studies, we verified that far simpler (and traditional) models seem to offer similar predictive powers, if not better ones. Those include an exponential law for magnitude prediction and a power law (approximated by a logistic regression or one artificial neuron) for aftershock prediction in space. Because of the structured, tabulated nature of earthquake catalogs, and the limited number of features so far considered, simpler and more transparent machine-learning models than ANNs seem preferable at the present stage of research. Those baseline models follow first physical principles and are consistent with the known empirical laws of statistical seismology (e.g., the Gutenberg–Richter law), which are already known to have minimal abilities to predict large earthquakes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Mignan","given":"Arnaud"},{"family":"Broccardo","given":"Marco"}],"citation-key":"Mignan.Broccardo_2020_NeuralNetwork","container-title":"Seismological Research Letters","DOI":"10.1785/0220200021","ISSN":"0895-0695, 1938-2057","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"2330-2342","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Neural Network Applications in Earthquake Prediction (1994–2019): Meta-Analytic and Statistical Insights on Their Limitations","title-short":"Neural Network Applications in Earthquake Prediction (1994–2019)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ssa/srl/article/91/4/2330/586519/Neural-Network-Applications-in-Earthquake","volume":"91"},

  {"id":"Minson.etal_2013_BayesianInversion","abstract":"The estimation of finite fault earthquake source models is an inherently underdetermined problem: there is no unique solution to the inverse problem of determining the rupture history at depth as a function of time and space when our data are limited to observations at the Earth's surface. Bayesian methods allow us to determine the set of all plausible source model parameters that are consistent with the observations, our a priori assumptions about the physics of the earthquake source and wave propagation, and models for the observation errors and the errors due to the limitations in our forward model. Because our inversion approach does not require inverting any matrices other than covariance matrices, we can restrict our ensemble of solutions to only those models that are physically defensible while avoiding the need to restrict our class of models based on considerations of numerical invertibility. We only use prior information that is consistent with the physics of the problem rather than some artefice (such as smoothing) needed to produce a unique optimal model estimate. Bayesian inference can also be used to estimate model-dependent and internally consistent effective errors due to shortcomings in the forward model or data interpretation, such as poor Green's functions or extraneous signals recorded by our instruments. Until recently, Bayesian techniques have been of limited utility for earthquake source inversions because they are computationally intractable for problems with as many free parameters as typically used in kinematic finite fault models. Our algorithm, called cascading adaptive transitional metropolis in parallel (CATMIP), allows sampling of high-dimensional problems in a parallel computing framework. CATMIP combines the Metropolis algorithm with elements of simulated annealing and genetic algorithms to dynamically optimize the algorithm's efficiency as it runs. The algorithm is a generic Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampler; it works independently of the model design, a priori constraints and data under consideration, and so can be used for a wide variety of scientific problems. We compare CATMIP's efficiency relative to several existing sampling algorithms and then present synthetic performance tests of finite fault earthquake rupture models computed using CATMIP.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Minson","given":"S.

  {"id":"Mirzaee.etal_2023_NonlinearPhase","abstract":"We describe a python package for nonlinear phase linking of full resolution SAR images using both distributed and persistent scatterers. In the workflow, the first step is to find for each pixel the set of self-similar pixels in order to identify persistent and distributed scatterers. Next the phase linking is performed using the full complex coherence matrix containing the wrapped phase values of each distributed scatterer. Our package uses a hybrid approach consisting of eigenvalue decomposition-based maximum likelihood phase linking and the classic eigenvalue decomposition method. The latter is used for pixels with a non-invertible covariance matrix. A sequential mode achieves computational efficiency. The next step is to unwrap the phase by selecting an optimum unwrapping network of interferograms and invert for the unwrapped phase time-series which is converted to the displacement time-series. We show how the performance of phase linking depends on the temporal correlation behavior using simulations of the coherence matrix. The sequential approaches better retrieve the simulated phases compared to the non-sequential approaches for all temporal coherence models. Phase linking methods retrieve the simulated phase with residuals close to the Cramér–Rao lower bound for coherent seasons where the absolute values of coherence matrix are high and provide a tool for obtaining InSAR measurements over areas with seasonal snowfall. We furthermore show that unwrapping errors propagate differently depending on the unwrapping network. For single-reference networks there is no error propagation, but for sequential networks it compromises the accuracy of the final displacement time-series. Delaunay networks provide an optimum solution in terms of accuracy and precision if there are several years of data with frequent temporal decorrelation or strong seasonal decorrelation. We present applications using Sentinel-1 data in different natural and anthropogenic environments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Mirzaee","given":"Sara"},{"family":"Amelung","given":"Falk"},{"family":"Fattahi","given":"Heresh"}],"citation-key":"Mirzaee.etal_2023_NonlinearPhase","container-title":"Computers & Geosciences","container-title-short":"Computers & Geosciences","DOI":"10.1016/j.cageo.2022.105291","ISSN":"0098-3004","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,1]]},"page":"105291","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Non-linear phase linking using joined distributed and persistent scatterers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098300422002400","volume":"171"},

We observe thinning of the lithosphere on the eastern side of the DST from 80 km in the north of the Dead Sea to about 65 km at the Gulf of Aqaba. On the western side of the DST, the few data indicate a thin LAB of about 65 km. For comparison, we found a 90-km-thick lithosphere in eastern Turkey and a 160-km-thick lithosphere under the Arabian shield, respectively. These observations support previous suggestions, based on xenolith data, heat flow observations, regional uplift history and geodynamic modelling, that the lithosphere around DST has been significantly thinned in the Late Cenozoic, likely following rifting and spreading of the Red Sea.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Mohsen","given":"Ayman"},{"family":"Kind","given":"Rainer"},{"family":"Sobolev","given":"Stephan V."},{"family":"Weber","given":"Michael"},{"literal":"DESERT Group"}],"citation-key":"Mohsen.etal_2006_ThicknessLithosphere","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","container-title-short":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2006.03185.x","ISSN":"0956-540X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",11,1]]},"note":"ZSCC:00052","page":"845-852","source":"Silverchair","title":"Thickness of the lithosphere east of the Dead Sea Transform","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2006.03185.x","volume":"167"},

Modern and ancient examples of rifts are known to overprint preexisting linear anisotropies in the crust and lithosphere, such as lithospheric boundaries, crustal sutures, and thermal anomalies. Here we investigate how propagating rifts interact with preexisting structures by using three-dimensional analogue experiments with rotational extensional boundary conditions and variably oriented linear weak zones in the lithospheric mantle. When linear weaknesses are oriented at low angles to the rift axis, early strain localization occurs in narrow domains, which merge at later stages, resulting in continental breakup by unzipping. Strong strain partitioning is observed when the linear heterogeneity is oriented at high angles with respect to the rift axis. In these experiments, early subparallel V-shaped basins propagate toward the pole of rotation until they are abandoned and strain is transferred entirely to structures developed in the vicinity of the strongly oblique weak lithosphere zone boundary. The experimental results are characterized in terms of their evolution, patterns of strain localization, and surface topography as a function of the lithospheric heterogeneity obliquity angle. Comparison of the experiments to ancient and modern examples in nature may help to elucidate the common but still poorly understood process of propagating rift-lithospheric heterogeneity interaction.","author":[{"family":"Molnar","given":"N E"},{"family":"Cruden","given":"A R"},{"family":"Betts","given":"P G"}],"citation-key":"Molnar.etal_InteractionsPropagating","language":"en","page":"24","source":"Zotero","title":"Interactions between propagating rotational rifts and linear rheological heterogeneities: Insights from three‐dimensional laboratory experiments","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"Muir.Ross_2023_DeepGaussian","abstract":"The spatio-temporal properties of seismicity give us incisive insight into the stress state evolution and fault structures of the crust. Empirical models based on self-exciting point processes continue to provide an important tool for analysing seismicity, given the epistemic uncertainty associated with physical models. In particular, the epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model acts as a reference model for studying seismicity catalogues. The traditional ETAS model uses simple parametric definitions for the background rate of triggering-independent seismicity. This reduces the effectiveness of the basic ETAS model in modelling the temporally complex seismicity patterns seen in seismic swarms that are dominated by aseismic tectonic processes such as fluid injection rather than aftershock triggering. In order to robustly capture time-varying seismicity rates, we introduce a deep Gaussian process (GP) formulation for the background rate as an extension to ETAS. GPs are a robust non-parametric model for function spaces with covariance structure. By conditioning the length-scale structure of a GP with another GP, we have a deep-GP: a probabilistic, hierarchical model that automatically tunes its structure to match data constraints. We show how the deep-GP-ETAS model can be efficiently sampled by making use of a Metropolis-within-Gibbs scheme, taking advantage of the branching process formulation of ETAS and a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approximation for Matérn GPs. We illustrate our method using synthetic examples, and show that the deep-GP-ETAS model successfully captures multiscale temporal behaviour in the background forcing rate of seismicity. We then apply the results to two real-data catalogues: the Ridgecrest, CA 2019 July 5 Mw 7.1 event catalogue, showing that deep-GP-ETAS can successfully characterize a classical aftershock sequence; and the 2016–2019 Cahuilla, CA earthquake swarm, which shows two distinct phases of aseismic forcing concordant with a fluid injection-driven initial sequence, arrest of the fluid along a physical barrier and release following the largest Mw 4.4 event of the sequence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Muir","given":"Jack B"},{"family":"Ross","given":"Zachary E"}],"citation-key":"Muir.Ross_2023_DeepGaussian","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","container-title-short":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1093/gji/ggad074","ISSN":"0956-540X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,1]]},"page":"427-438","source":"Silverchair","title":"A deep Gaussian process model for seismicity background rates","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggad074","volume":"234"},

  {"id":"Munchmeyer.etal_2022_WhichPicker","abstract":"Seismic event detection and phase picking are the base of many seismological workflows. In recent years, several publications demonstrated that deep learning approaches significantly outperform classical approaches, achieving human-like performance under certain circumstances. However, as studies differ in the datasets and evaluation tasks, it is unclear how the different approaches compare to each other. Furthermore, there are no systematic studies about model performance in cross-domain scenarios, that is, when applied to data with different characteristics. Here, we address these questions by conducting a large-scale benchmark. We compare six previously published deep learning models on eight data sets covering local to teleseismic distances and on three tasks: event detection, phase identification and onset time picking. Furthermore, we compare the results to a classical Baer-Kradolfer picker. Overall, we observe the best performance for EQTransformer, GPD and PhaseNet, with a small advantage for EQTransformer on teleseismic data. Furthermore, we conduct a cross-domain study, analyzing model performance on data sets they were not trained on. We show that trained models can be transferred between regions with only mild performance degradation, but models trained on regional data do not transfer well to teleseismic data. As deep learning for detection and picking is a rapidly evolving field, we ensured extensibility of our benchmark by building our code on standardized frameworks and making it openly accessible.

  {"id":"Nadeau.Johnson_SeismologicalStudies","abstract":"Waveform data from a borehole network of broadband seismographic stations have been used to study microearthquakes along the Parkfield segment of the San Andreas fault (SAF). Analysis of almost 10 years of such data demonstrates that much of the seismicity in this region consists of repeating sequences, quasiperiodic sequences of earthquakes that are essentially identical in terms of waveform, size, and location. Scalar seismic moments have been estimated for 53 of these repeating sequences and combined with equivalent estimates from 8 similar but larger event sequences from the Stone Canyon section of the fault and the main Parkfield sequence. These estimates show that seismic moment is being released as a function of time in a very regular manner. Measurements of the moment release rate, combined with an assumed tectonic loading rate, lead to estimates of the seismic parameters source area, slip, and recurrence interval. Such parameters exhibit a systematic dependence upon source size over a range of 101° in seismic moment that can be described by three simple scaling relationships. Several implications of these scaling relationships are explored, including the repeat time of earthquakes, average stress drop, strength of the fault, and heat generated by earthquakes. What emerges from this analysis of moment release rates is a quantitative description of an earthquake process that is controlled by small strong asperities that occupy less than 1% of the fault area. This means that the fault is highly heterogeneous with respect to stress, strength, and heat generation. Such heterogeneity helps to explain many of the apparent contradictions that are encountered in the study of earthquakes, such as why faults appear weak, why significant heat flow is not observed, how significant high frequencies can be generated by large earthquakes, and how various geologic features such as pseudotachylytes might form.","author":[{"family":"Nadeau","given":"Robert M"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Lane R"}],"citation-key":"Nadeau.Johnson_SeismologicalStudies","language":"en","page":"25","source":"Zotero","title":"Seismological Studies at Parkfield VI: Moment Release Rates and Estimates of Source Parameters for Small Repeating Earthquakes","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"Nairn.etal_1995_GeologyEruptive","abstract":"Rabaul Caldera is the most recently active (1937–1943) of four adjoining volcanic centres aligned north-south through the northern extremity of eastern New Britain. Geological mapping after the 1983–1985 Rabaul seismic and deformation crisis has partially revealed a long and complex eruption history dominated by numerous explosive eruptions, the largest accompanied by caldera collapse. The oldest exposed eruptives are the basaltic pre-caldera cone Tovanumbatir Lavas KAr dated at 0.5 Ma. The dacitic Rabaul Quarry Lavas exposed in the caldera wall and KAr dated at 0.19 Ma, are overlain by a sequence of dacitic and andesitic pyroclastic flow and fall deposits. Uplifted coral reef limestones, interbedded within the pyroclastic sequence on the northeast coast, suggest that explosive eruptions in the Rabaul area had commenced prior to the 0.125 Ma last interglacial high sea level stand. The pyroclastic sequence includes the large Boroi Ignimbrites and Malaguna Pyroclastics both 40Ar39Ar dated at about 0.1 Ma, and the Barge Tunnel Ignimbrite 40Ar39Ar dated at around 0.04 Ma. Few reliable ages exist for the many younger eruptives. These include Holocene ignimbrites of the latest caldera-forming eruptions—the Raluan Pyroclastics variously dated (14C) at either about 3500 or 7000 yr B.P., and the ca. 1400 yr B.P. Rabaul Pyroclastics. At least eight intracaldera eruptions have occurred since the 1400 yr B.P. collapse, building small pyroclastic and lava cones within the caldera. A major erosional episode is evident as a widespread unconformity in the upper pyroclastic stratigraphy at Rabaul. Lacking relevant radiometric ages, this episode is assumed to have occurred during last glaciation low sea levels and is here arbitarily dated at ca. ?20 ka. At least five, possibly nine, significant ignimbrite eruptions have occurred at Rabaul during the last ?20 ka. The new eruptive history differs considerably from that previously published, which considered ignimbrite eruption and caldera collapse to have first occurred at 3500 yr B.P. Rabaul volcanism has been dominated by two main types: (a) basaltic and basaltic andesite cone building eruptions; and (b) dacitic, and rarely andesitic or rhyolitic, plinian/ignimbrite eruptions of both high- and low-aspect ratio types. The 1400 yr B.P. Rabaul Ignimbrite is a type example of a low-aspect ratio, high-energy, and potentially very damaging eruption. Fine vitric ash deposits, common in the Rabaul pyroclastic sequence, demonstrate the frequent modification of eruptions by external water probably related to early caldera lakes or bays. Interbedding of these fine ashes with plinian pumice lapilli beds suggests that many early eruptions occurred from multiple vents, located in both wet and dry areas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Nairn","given":"I.

Major- and trace-element modeling shows that Cerro Azul, Alcedo and Sierra Negra share a similar depth of melting and source composition. Modeling also reveals that there are small, systematic differences in the extent of partial melting between the volcanoes that can be related to their distance from the proposed plume center below the westernmost island of Fernandina. However, even though melts segregating from the plume in the western Galápagos reflect a narrow range of temperatures and source compositions, there are wide variations in the enrichments of major and trace elements between Cerro Azul, Alcedo and Sierra Negra that cannot be attributed to mantle processes. We believe the observed intershield geochemical differences result from magma supply and cooling rates that are unique to each volcano, and reflect the variations in lithospheric transport and storage processes across the western archipelago.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",2,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Naumann","given":"Terry"},{"family":"Geist","given":"Dennis"},{"family":"Kurz","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"Naumann.etal_2002_PetrologyGeochemistry","container-title":"Journal of Petrology","container-title-short":"J Petrology","DOI":"10.1093/petrology/43.5.859","ISSN":"0022-3530","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"859-883","source":"academic.oup.com","title":"Petrology and Geochemistry of Volcán Cerro Azul: Petrologic Diversity among the Western Galápagos Volcanoes","title-short":"Petrology and Geochemistry of Volcán Cerro Azul","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/petrology/article/43/5/859/1474649","volume":"43"},

The highly non?double?couple nature of the focal mechanisms for several of the events previously reported in the Harvard centroid moment tensor (CMT) catalog is confirmed by analysis of an expanded long?period body wave data set, as well as by an independent inversion of intermediate period surface wave data. Modeling of broadband P waveforms constrains the depths of the events to lie between 3 km and 8 km beneath the volcano. Significant complexity in the P waves observed for some events is best explained by a sequence of subevents of varying geometry, rather than by wave propagation effects caused by shallow structure near the earthquake. Inversion of P wave data for two of the earthquakes using a parameterization with subsources results in sequences of events with primarily thrust motion on planes of varying strike. The seismological results are interpreted as faulting on an outward dipping cone?shaped ring fault beneath the Bárdarbunga caldera. The association in time and space between the September 29, 1996, earthquake and the September 30 eruption near Bárdarbunga and Grimsvötn Volcanos suggests that inflation of a shallow magma chamber, and the associated stress loading of the deeper ring fault, may be the tectonic process which generates the earthquakes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Nettles","given":"Meredith"},{"family":"Ekström","given":"Göran"}],"citation-key":"Nettles.Ekstrom_1998_FaultingMechanism","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","container-title-short":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/98JB01392","ISSN":"0148-0227","issue":"B8","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",8,10]]},"page":"17973-17983","source":"agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","title":"Faulting mechanism of anomalous earthquakes near Bárdarbunga Volcano, Iceland","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/98JB01392","volume":"103"},
  {"id":"Nikkhoo.etal_2017_CompoundDislocation","abstract":"Volcanic crises are often preceded and accompanied by volcano deformation caused by magmatic and hydrothermal processes. Fast and efficient model identification and parameter estimation techniques for various sources of deformation are crucial for process understanding, volcano hazard assessment and early warning purposes. As a simple model that can be a basis for rapid inversion techniques, we present a compound dislocation model (CDM) that is composed of three mutually orthogonal rectangular dislocations (RDs). We present new RD solutions, which are free of artefact singularities and that also possess full rotational degrees of freedom. The CDM can represent both planar intrusions in the near field and volumetric sources of inflation and deflation in the far field. Therefore, this source model can be applied to shallow dikes and sills, as well as to deep planar and equidimensional sources of any geometry, including oblate, prolate and other triaxial ellipsoidal shapes. In either case the sources may possess any arbitrary orientation in space. After systematically evaluating the CDM, we apply it to the co-eruptive displacements of the 2015 Calbuco eruption observed by the Sentinel-1A satellite in both ascending and descending orbits. The results show that the deformation source is a deflating vertical lens-shaped source at an approximate depth of 8 km centred beneath Calbuco volcano. The parameters of the optimal source model clearly show that it is significantly different from an isotropic point source or a single dislocation model. The Calbuco example reflects the convenience of using the CDM for a rapid interpretation of deformation data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",2,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Nikkhoo","given":"Mehdi"},{"family":"Walter","given":"Thomas R."},{"family":"Lundgren","given":"Paul R."},{"family":"Prats-Iraola","given":"Pau"}],"citation-key":"Nikkhoo.etal_2017_CompoundDislocation","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","container-title-short":"Geophys J Int","DOI":"10.1093/gji/ggw427","ISSN":"0956-540X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"877-894","source":"academic.oup.com","title":"Compound dislocation models (CDMs) for volcano deformation analyses","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/208/2/877/2454292","volume":"208"},

While syneruptive signals are often detected and analyzed with regional or/and global seismic networks to retrieve eruption location and mechanism, repetitive noneruptive volcanoseismic signals are generally small, and they are typically detected with in situ stations near the volcanic edifices. Here, we show that repetitive VLP and synchronous deformation events in Aso volcano, Japan, can be detected in the high (15–30 s) and low (50–100 s) VLP bands, respectively, at seismic stations located ∼30–1,000 km away from their sources. Changes in the polarities, phases, and amplitudes of VLP and synchronous deformation events observed at the in situ stations can be verified by the seismic waves in the two VLP bands, respectively, at distant stations up to 150 km. Forward modeling of the amplitude decay in the two VLP bands against epicentral distance corroborates the source locations previously determined by the in situ data, whereas the joint data analysis of in situ and distant stations at high VLP band suggests the presence of single-force component (i.e., force/moment ratio of 10−4 m−1) in the source of VLPs. We advocate that not only can systematic data mining against established global and regional seismic networks potentially expand the detection capability of repetitive volcanoseismic signals backward in time when in situ observations were unavailable, but it could also substantially improve the detection and monitoring capacity in otherwise uninstrumented volcanoes, complementary to remote sensing of ground deformation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Niu","given":"Jieming"},{"family":"Song","given":"Teh-Ru Alex"}],"citation-key":"Niu.Song_2022_ValidationRepetitive","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/2021JB023400","ISSN":"2169-9356","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","page":"e2021JB023400","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Validation of Repetitive Volcanoseismic Signals in Aso Volcano, Japan With Distant Stations: Implications of Source Characterization and Remote Sensing in Uninstrumented Volcanoes","title-short":"Validation of Repetitive Volcanoseismic Signals in Aso Volcano, Japan With Distant Stations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2021JB023400","volume":"127"},
  {"id":"Noda.etal_2021_EnergyBasedScenarios","abstract":"We propose a new energy-based method to construct rupture scenarios for anticipated megathrust earthquakes by using an interseismic slip-deficit model. Our method bridges the gap between two well-known approaches, namely, kinematic and dynamic modeling. We construct the source model as a static-slip distribution, greatly reducing the computational load, and then examine whether the model follows the mechanics of faulting from the perspective of the energy balance of fault rupture. To quantify the energy balance, we introduce “residual energy,” which is defined as the difference between the strain energy released by the fault slip and the energy dissipated on the fault. Positive residual energy is a necessary condition for earthquake generation, which means that even if slip deficits accumulate, an earthquake does not occur unless the strain energy accumulation exceeds the dissipated energy. We apply the method to interplate earthquakes in the Nankai trough subduction zone, southwest Japan. Assuming a stress accumulation time of 150 years, 5 out of 10 scenarios meet the necessary condition, and one of these models can explain the crustal deformation of a historical Nankai earthquake. The significant amount of strain energy released by a rupture off Cape Muroto makes the scenario involving rupture of the whole subduction zone possible. The estimation of residual energy suggests that fault ruptures reaching the Nankai trough require more strain energy than buried ruptures. All of the scenarios eventually meet the condition, because the strain energy increases more with time than the fracture energy predicted from empirical scaling relationships.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Noda","given":"Akemi"},{"family":"Saito","given":"Tatsuhiko"},{"family":"Fukuyama","given":"Eiichi"},{"family":"Urata","given":"Yumi"}],"citation-key":"Noda.etal_2021_EnergyBasedScenarios","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/2020JB020417","ISSN":"2169-9356","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"e2020JB020417","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Energy-Based Scenarios for Great Thrust-Type Earthquakes in the Nankai Trough Subduction Zone, Southwest Japan, Using an Interseismic Slip-Deficit Model","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020JB020417","volume":"126"},

Such a water-level change could potentially give rise to a resolvable lithospheric rebound and regional uplift, with spatial extent and amplitude that are controlled by the effective mechanical properties of the crust and upper mantle combined. We measure that deformation for the years 1993 to 2001, using 149 short baseline interferograms made of 31 ERS-1 and ERS-2 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and continuous GPS data from the Survey of Israel recorded between 1997 and 2011. The uplift rate at the Dead Sea is small (up to 4 mm/year), and the basin topography is almost a mirror of the displacement, introducing a strong trade-off between uplift and stratified atmosphere noise. To overcome this complication, we impose a linearity constraint on the satellite to ground Line Of Sight (LOS) phase changes based on the steady uplift observed by a continuous GPS station in the area of interest, and simultaneously solve for the LOS change rate, Digital Elevation Model (DEM) errors and the elevation-phase correlation. While the LOS rate and DEM errors are solved for each pixel independently, the elevation-phase correlation is solved for each SAR acquisition independently. Using this approach we separated the stratified atmospheric delay from the ground displacement. We observed a regional uplift around the Dead Sea northern basin, with maximum uplift close to the shorelines, and diminishing to zero by the Mediterranean coast. We modeled the effect of water load changes using a homogeneous elastic half-space, and found a good agreement between modeled and observed ground displacements using elastic properties that are compatible with seismic and gravity data down to a depth of 15 km below the Dead Sea basin, suggesting that the response of the crust to the sea level drop is controlled mainly by the elastic properties of the upper-crust immediately below the Dead Sea basin.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Nof","given":"R.

As the estimation of subsurface fault slip is inherently ill-posed, common inversion methods usually require a regularization term to counteract instabilities. Such regularization introduces biases in inferred slip estimates. Here, we discuss the effects that prior information, implied by a given regularization scheme, can have on fault slip estimates. We propose a novel Equal Posterior Information Condition (EPIC)—based Tikhonov regularization that generalizes the concept of prior information. The EPIC determines variances of prior information based on a chosen form of the structure of the posterior covariance matrix. In the context of subduction zone earthquakes, use of the EPIC counterbalances the spatial heterogeneity of observational constraints on fault slip, improving stability, quality and interpretability of fault slip estimates. We investigate the efficiency of the EPIC in the context of various synthetic fault slip distributions. We also demonstrate the methodology by inferring co-seismic slip from geodetic data for the 2011 (Mw 9.0) Tohoku-Oki, Japan, earthquake, obtaining robust slip estimates that are similar to those inferred using a unregularized fully Bayesian approach.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Ortega-Culaciati","given":"F."},{"family":"Simons","given":"M."},{"family":"Ruiz","given":"J."},{"family":"Rivera","given":"L."},{"family":"Díaz-Salazar","given":"N."}],"citation-key":"Ortega-Culaciati.etal_2021_EPICTikhonov","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/2020JB021141","ISSN":"2169-9356","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"e2020JB021141","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"An EPIC Tikhonov Regularization: Application to Quasi-Static Fault Slip Inversion","title-short":"An EPIC Tikhonov Regularization","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020JB021141","volume":"126"},

However, multiple challenges exist in tying independently processed velocity data sets to a common reference frame and producing high-resolution strain rate fields. We analyze Sentinel-1 data acquired between 2014 and 2019 over the northeast Tibetan Plateau, and develop new methods to derive east and vertical velocities with ∼100 m resolution and ∼1 mm/yr accuracy across an area of 440,000 km2. By implementing a new method of combining horizontal gradients of filtered east and interpolated north velocities, we derive the first ∼1 km resolution strain rate field for this tectonically active region. The strain rate fields show concentrated shear strain along the Haiyuan and East Kunlun Faults, and local contractional strain on fault junctions, within the Qilianshan thrusts, and around the Longyangxia Reservoir. The Laohushan-Jingtai creeping section of the Haiyuan Fault is highlighted in our data set by extremely rapid strain rates. Strain across unknown portions of the Haiyuan Fault system, including shear on the eastern extension of the Dabanshan Fault and contraction at the western flank of the Quwushan, highlight unmapped tectonic structures. In addition to the uplift across most of the lowlands, the vertical velocities also contain climatic, hydrological or anthropogenic-related deformation signals. We demonstrate the enhanced view of large-scale active tectonic processes provided by high-resolution velocities and strain rates derived from Sentinel-1 data and highlight associated wide-ranging research applications.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Ou","given":"Q."},{"family":"Daout","given":"S."},{"family":"Weiss","given":"J.

In the southern Great Plains, we find crustal uplift of up to 2 mm/year in an area approximately 670 km × 280 km. This signal is spatially correlated with the area of greatest groundwater decline in the southern High Plains aquifer. To determine the uplift mechanism and its possible relation to aquifer depletion, we investigate changes in aquifer water content. Gravity data coupled with an elastic model show the uplift rate is consistent with hydrological unloading from anthropogenic aquifer depletion exacerbated by severe drought. Our model that encompasses two regions of greatest groundwater decline indicates a water volume loss of −5.1 km3/year is sufficient to match the observed signal. In other large aquifers, vertical crustal motions associated with groundwater depletion are often dominated by near-field subsidence. Our results challenge the perception that vertical motions driven by aquifer depletion necessarily equate to near-field subsidence. In the High Plains system, depletion causes near-field uplift because of the combination of mass removal and the style of geologic reservoir. As current climate change models predict aggravated drought conditions in the southern Great Plains in the coming decades, we expect to see an increasing rate of uplift caused by groundwater depletion unless there is offsetting recharge or changes in water resource management.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Overacker","given":"Justine"},{"family":"Hammond","given":"William C."},{"family":"Blewitt","given":"Geoffrey"},{"family":"Kreemer","given":"Corné"}],"citation-key":"Overacker.etal_2022_VerticalLand","container-title":"Water Resources Research","DOI":"10.1029/2021WR031635","ISSN":"1944-7973","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC:00001","page":"e2021WR031635","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Vertical Land Motion of the High Plains Aquifer Region of the United States: Effect of Aquifer Confinement Style, Climate Variability, and Anthropogenic Activity","title-short":"Vertical Land Motion of the High Plains Aquifer Region of the United States","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2021WR031635","volume":"58"},

The GPS data show that the south flank of the volcano, which has generated several large earthquakes in the past 3 decades, is displacing at up to ?8 cm/yr to the south?southeast. The summit and rift zones are subsiding, with maximum subsidence rates of ?8 cm/yr observed a few kilometers south of the summit caldera. Elastic dislocation modeling of the GPS data suggests that the active sources of deformation include deep rift opening along the upper east and east rift zone, fault slip along a subhorizontal fault near the base of the volcano, and deflation near the summit caldera. A nonlinear optimization algorithm was used to explore the parameter space and to find the best fitting source geometry. There is a broad range of model geometries that fit the data reasonably well. However, certain models can be ruled out, including those that have shallow rift opening or shallow fault slip. Some offshore, aseismic slip on a fault plane that dips between 25° northnorthwest and 8° south?southeast is required.

  {"id":"Pacheco.etal_1993_NatureSeismic","abstract":"The downdip width of the seismogenic zone is defined for 19 subduction zones. This width is measured from the base of the accretionary prism to the maximum depth of nucleation of thrust events along the plate boundary. Those two points are taken to define the upper and lower depth transitions from stable to unstable frictional sliding. The lower depth transition is found to be between 35 and 70 km. The dip angle of the thrust zone is also reevaluated. We find a linear increase in the dip angle as a function of depth, the slope of which varies between 0.2° and 0.6° km−1. The downdip width obtained, which is generally narrower than previously determined by most other authors, varies from about 50 to 150 km. We also determine the ratio of the rate of slip that occurs in earthquakes to the rate of relative plate motion. This ratio is defined as the seismic coupling coefficient (a). We obtain two different estimates of the seismic coupling coefficient: an average value from 90 years of seismicity and a value obtained using the slip-predictable recurrence model for large earthquakes. We find a large variation in the computed values of a along and among subduction zones. For most of the subduction zones a is much less than 1.0; for several it is less than a few percent. Worldwide, we find no significant correlation between either the seismic coupling coefficient or the width of the seismogenic zone and subduction parameters such as the age of the oceanic lithosphere that is being subducted, plate convergence rates or absolute velocity of the upper plate in the hot spot reference frame. Such correlation exists only for a few individual subduction zones where other parameters do not vary as much. The observed variations in seismic coupling could be explained as differences in the frictional behavior of materials at the plate interface. Some of these differences may be attributed to the subduction of large bathymetric features, the roughness of topography, the presence of unstable triple junctions and active-spreading ridges, and sediment composition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Pacheco","given":"Javier F."},{"family":"Sykes","given":"Lynn R."},{"family":"Scholz","given":"Christopher H."}],"citation-key":"Pacheco.etal_1993_NatureSeismic","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/93JB00349","ISSN":"2156-2202","issue":"B8","issued":{"date-parts":[["1993"]]},"language":"en","page":"14133-14159","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Nature of seismic coupling along simple plate boundaries of the subduction type","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/93JB00349","volume":"98"},

Here we revisit their result, using newer earthquake data recorded after version 3.0 of the CFM was completed. We find that the correlation between earthquake size and proximity to major faults is not present in the newer seismicity data. This indicates that to some degree, the CFM is overtuned to past seismicity, with some structures related to transient features in seismicity rather than persistent geologic features. We also search for differences in aftershock productivity and foreshock statistics near faults and find that they are also “fault-tolerant”—that is, insensitive to distance from major faults.

Analysis of interferograms spanning different times from 1992 to 2000 allows us to separate two distinct co-eruptive deformation periods in areas outside the ice cap. Diking at the Bárdarbunga caldera rim appears to be responsible for deformation during the first week of eruption while significant deflation occurred at Bárdarbunga only after October 6 when most of the magma had already been erupted at Gjálp. A pressure connection between the Bárdarbunga volcano and the Gjálp eruptive fissure is inferred.

Our ﬁndings indicate that the state of stress is characterized by the coexistence of a normal faulting stress regime with the primarily strike-slip one, according to the regional frame illustrated by previous geological and seismological observations. An updated velocity ﬁeld computed from new observations and earlier published data depicts the general left-lateral motion of the Dead Sea Fault System well. In agreement with previous studies, we detected some differences in the slip-rate pattern between the northern and the southern sectors of the fault system. The geodetic strain-rate ﬁeld highlights how much of the deformation is accommodated along the fault system itself in a narrow region. The comparison between the stress and the strain-rate directions reveals that both orientations are near-parallel, clearly indicating that present-day crustal stress and ground deformation patterns are chieﬂy driven by the same tectonic processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Palano","given":"Mimmo"},{"family":"Imprescia","given":"Paola"},{"family":"Gresta","given":"Stefano"}],"citation-key":"Palano.etal_2013_CurrentStress","container-title":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","container-title-short":"Earth and Planetary Science Letters","DOI":"10.1016/j.epsl.2013.03.043","ISSN":"0012821X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",5]]},"language":"en","page":"305-316","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Current stress and strain-rate fields across the Dead Sea Fault System: Constraints from seismological data and GPS observations","title-short":"Current stress and strain-rate fields across the Dead Sea Fault System","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0012821X13001647","volume":"369-370"},
  {"id":"Pallister.etal_2010_BroadAccommodation","abstract":"The extensive harrat lava province of Arabia formed during the past 30 million years in response to Red Sea rifting and mantle upwelling. The area was regarded as seismically quiet, but between April and June 2009 a swarm of more than 30,000 earthquakes struck one of the lava fields in the province, Harrat Lunayyir, northwest Saudi Arabia. Concerned that larger damaging earthquakes might occur, the Saudi Arabian government evacuated 40,000 people from the region. Here we use geologic, geodetic and seismic data to show that the earthquake swarm resulted from magmatic dyke intrusion. We document a surface fault rupture that is 8 km long with 91 cm of offset. Surface deformation is best modelled by the shallow intrusion of a north-west trending dyke that is about 10 km long. Seismic waves generated during the earthquakes exhibit overlapping very low- and high-frequency components. We interpret the low frequencies to represent intrusion of magma and the high frequencies to represent fracturing of the crystalline basement rocks. Rather than extension being accommodated entirely by the central Red Sea rift axis, we suggest that the broad deformation observed in Harrat Lunayyir indicates that rift margins can remain as active sites of extension throughout rifting. Our analyses allowed us to forecast the likelihood of a future eruption or large earthquake in the region and informed the decisions made by the Saudi Arabian government to return the evacuees.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",2,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Pallister","given":"John S."},{"family":"McCausland","given":"Wendy A."},{"family":"Jónsson","given":"Sigurjón"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Zhong"},{"family":"Zahran","given":"Hani M."},{"family":"Hadidy","given":"Salah El"},{"family":"Aburukbah","given":"Abdallah"},{"family":"Stewart","given":"Ian C.

Geophysical inferences of the viscosity structure, however, have shown large variability depending on the types of observables used or the assumptions imposed1–3. Here, we study the mantle viscosity structure by using the postseismic deformation following a deep (approximately 560 km) earthquake located near the bottom of the upper mantle. We apply independent component analysis4 to geodetic time series to successfully detect and extract the postseismic deformation induced by the moment magnitude 8.2, 2018 Fiji earthquake. To search for the viscosity structure that can explain the detected signal, we perform forward viscoelastic relaxation modelling5,6 with a range of viscosity structures. We find that our observation requires a relatively thin (approximately 100 km), low-viscosity (1017 to 1018 Pa s) layer at the bottom of the mantle transition zone. Such a weak zone could explain the slab flattening7 and orphaning8 observed in numerous subduction zones, which are otherwise challenging to explain in the whole mantle convection regime.

  {"id":"Peltier.etal_2009_FormationApril","abstract":"On April 5th 2007, a major collapse of the Dolomieu summit crater occurred at Piton de La Fournaise volcano (La Réunion Island). To constrain the origin and the dynamics of the collapse, we modelled continuous GPS displacements preceding and accompanying this event. Our results reveal that the Dolomieu collapse formed by a “piston-like” mechanism, in which the fast draining of the shallow magma reservoir at the beginning of the March 30th–May 1st 2007 eruption caused a gravity-driven downward displacement of its roof. During the five days preceding the collapse, summit deflation was caused by volume change through the fractured rock column above the shallow magma chamber due to the closure of voids or small-scale cavities or the upward stoping and migration of an underground cavity. Since 2000, weakening of the rock column by repeated refilling and draining of the shallow magma chamber favoured its destabilization. On April 5th, 7 h before the onset of the collapse, the deflation source was located at ~300 m depth revealing the initiation of the collapse at very shallow depth. The sudden collapse on April 5th was followed by continuous cyclic subsidence until April 6th. Each cycle was characterized by a progressive inward deflation of the summit zone and ended by sudden summit outward displacements caused by stress relaxation following a collapse event. Subsidence of the stoped column in the magma reservoir during the collapse of the crater on April 5th and 6th acted as a piston thus increasing the eruption rate. The collapse occurred in only 24 h by successive events and increased the depth of the Dolomieu crater by 340 m. After April 6th, only minor readjustments of the summit cone occurred with slight summit deflation and small landslides of the caldera walls.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Peltier","given":"Aline"},{"family":"Staudacher","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Bachèlery","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Cayol","given":"Valérie"}],"citation-key":"Peltier.etal_2009_FormationApril","collection-title":"Recent advances on the geodynamics of Piton de la Fournaise volcano","container-title":"Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research","container-title-short":"Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research","DOI":"10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2008.09.009","ISSN":"0377-0273","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",7,1]]},"page":"152-163","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Formation of the April 2007 caldera collapse at Piton de La Fournaise volcano: Insights from GPS data","title-short":"Formation of the April 2007 caldera collapse at Piton de La Fournaise volcano","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377027308004848","volume":"184"},
  {"id":"Peltzer.etal_1994_AnalysisCoseismic","abstract":"The map of the coseismic displacement field generated by interferometric processing of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images taken before and after the June 28, 1992, Landers earthquake sequence brings new insights into the nature of deformation caused by these earthquakes. We use the interferometric map generated by Massonnet et al. (1993) to analyze the surface displacement field in the vicinity of the fault trace. Complexities in the fringe pattern near the fault reflect short‐wavelength variations of the surface rupture and slip distribution, and attest to large displacement gradients. Along two sections of the fault, characteristic fringe patterns can be recognized, contrasting in density and direction with patterns observed away from the rupture. In order to understand the observed fringe patterns, we compute synthetic interferograms in three simple cases: (1) rigid‐body rotations about a vertical axis, (2) about a horizontal axis (tilt), and (3) distributed, simple shear. The orientation and spatial separation of interferometric fringes predicted by these models help constrain near‐field deformation and rupture parameters. Where the Kickapoo fault connects with the Homestead Valley fault, the interferogram shows a clear pattern of parallel N20°W fringes separated by about 160 m. This pattern and vertical offsets measured along the Kickapoo fault suggest that the block between this fault and the Johnson Valley fault may have been tilted, down to the west. A 5‐km block lifted by l m on one side would be tilted by an angle of 0.01° (190 μrad), producing fringes separated by about 160 m, parallel to the tilt axis. Such a tilt, parallel to a N20°W direction, would account for the gradual, northward increase of the vertical slip component observed along the Kickapoo fault. This tilt may also explain the 1 m of reverse slip observed along the “slip gap” section of the Homestead Valley break. Between the southern end of the Johnson Valley fault and the Eureka Peak fault, where no surface rupture has been mapped, the dense pattern of fringes implies distributed shear, probably resulting from fault slip at depth. The density and direction of the fringes in the gap are consistent with a right‐lateral slip of 1.2–3.8 m on a blind fault locked above the depth of 1.5–2 km. Such observations of small wavelength features in the SAR interferogram bring new insights into the near‐field displacement gradient and thus on response of the uppermost crust to seismic rupture.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Peltzer","given":"Gilles"},{"family":"Hudnut","given":"Kenneth W."},{"family":"Feigl","given":"Kurt L."}],"citation-key":"Peltzer.etal_1994_AnalysisCoseismic","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/94JB01888","ISSN":"2156-2202","issue":"B11","issued":{"date-parts":[["1994"]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC:00099","page":"21971-21981","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Analysis of coseismic surface displacement gradients using radar interferometry: New insights into the Landers earthquake","title-short":"Analysis of coseismic surface displacement gradients using radar interferometry","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/94JB01888","volume":"99"},

To correct the orbit errors, we used a linear surface model to model the relative displacements of the Global Positioning System (GPS) precise point positioning (PPP) in the line of sight (LOS) direction as a priori parameter of the long-wavelength crustal deformation signals. After correcting the orbit errors, an ocean tide model was applied to correct the OTL effect in the DInSAR interferograms. The proposed approach was veriﬁed with the DInSAR interferograms from the Los Angeles basin. The experimental results conﬁrm that the real orbit errors can be modeled by the bilinear ramp function under the constraint of the priori parameter.

The increasing availability of SAR data collected by complementary illumination angles and from different RADAR instruments, which operate in various bands of the microwave spectrum (X-, L- and C-band), makes the use of multi-track/multi-satellite InSAR techniques very promising for the characterization of deformation patterns.

  {"id":"Pingue_2004_3DModelling","abstract":"Campi Flegrei is a caldera complex located west of Naples, Italy. The last eruption occurred in 1538, although the volcano has produced unrest episodes since then, involving rapid and large ground movements (up to 2 m vertical in two years), accompanied by intense seismic activity. Surface ground displacements detected by various techniques (mainly InSAR and levelling) for the 1970 to 1996 period can be modelled by a shallow point source in an elastic half-space, however the source depth is not compatible with seismic and drill hole observations, which suggest a magma chamber just below 4 km depth. This apparent paradox has been explained by the presence of boundary fractures marking the caldera collapse. We present here the first full 3-D modelling for the unrest of 1982-1985 including the effect of caldera bordering fractures and the topography. To model the presence of topography and of the complex caldera rim discontinuities, we used a mixed boundary elements method. The a priori caldera geometry is determined initially from gravimetric modelling results and refined by inversion. The presence of the caldera discontinuities allows a fit to the 1982-1985 levelling data as good as, or better than, in the continuous half-space case, with quite a different source depth which fits the actual magma chamber position as seen from seismic waves. These results show the importance of volcanic structures, and mainly of caldera collapses, in ground deformation episodes.","author":[{"family":"Pingue","given":"Folco"}],"citation-key":"Pingue_2004_3DModelling","container-title":"Pure appl. geophys.","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"language":"en","page":"16","source":"Zotero","title":"3-D Modelling of Campi Flegrei Ground Deformations: Role of Caldera Boundary Discontinuities","type":"article-journal","volume":"161"},
  {"id":"Pirouz.etal_2017_FlexuralBending","abstract":"We constrain and model the geometry of the Zagros foreland to assess the equivalent elastic thickness of the northern edge of the Arabian plate and the loads that have originated due to the Arabia–Eurasia collision. The Oligo-Miocene Asmari formation, and its equivalents in Iraq and Syria, is used to estimate the post-collisional subsidence as they separate passive margin sediments from the younger foreland deposits. The depth to these formations is obtained by synthesizing a large database of well logs, seismic profiles and structural sections from the Mesopotamian basin and the Persian Gulf. The foreland depth varies along strike of the Zagros wedge between 1 and 6 km. The foreland is deepest beneath the Dezful embayment, in southwest Iran, and becomes shallower towards both ends. We investigate how the geometry of the foreland relates to the range topography loading based on simple flexural models. Deflection of the Arabian plate is modelled using point load distribution and convolution technique. The results show that the foreland depth is well predicted with a flexural model which assumes loading by the basin sedimentary fill, and thickened crust of the Zagros. The model also predicts a Moho depth consistent with Free-Air anomalies over the foreland and Zagros wedge. The equivalent elastic thickness of the flexed Arabian lithosphere is estimated to be ca. 50 km. We conclude that other sources of loading of the lithosphere, either related to the density variations (e.g. due to a possible lithospheric root) or dynamic origin (e.g. due to sublithospheric mantle flow or lithospheric buckling) have a negligible influence on the foreland geometry, Moho depth and topography of the Zagros. We calculate the shortening across the Zagros assuming conservation of crustal mass during deformation, trapping of all the sediments eroded from the range in the foreland, and an initial crustal thickness of 38 km. This calculation implies a minimum of 126 ± 18 km of crustal shortening due to ophiolite obduction and post-collisional shortening.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Pirouz","given":"Mortaza"},{"family":"Avouac","given":"Jean-Philippe"},{"family":"Gualandi","given":"Adriano"},{"family":"Hassanzadeh","given":"Jamshid"},{"family":"Sternai","given":"Pietro"}],"citation-key":"Pirouz.etal_2017_FlexuralBending","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","container-title-short":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1093/gji/ggx252","ISSN":"0956-540X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9,1]]},"note":"ZSCC:00037","page":"1659-1680","source":"Silverchair","title":"Flexural bending of the Zagros foreland basin","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggx252","volume":"210"},

  {"id":"Platt.Becker_2013_KinematicsRotating","abstract":"Sets of E- to NE-trending sinistral and/or reverse faults occur within the San Andreas system, and are associated with palaeomagnetic evidence for clockwise vertical-axis rotations. These structures cut across the trend of active dextral faults, posing questions as to how displacement is transferred across them. Geodetic data show that they lie within an overall dextral shear field, but the data are commonly interpreted to indicate little or no slip, nor any significant rate of rotation. We model these structures as rotating by bookshelf slip in a dextral shear field, and show that a combination of sinistral slip and rotation can produce the observed velocity field. This allows prediction of rates of slip, rotation, fault-parallel extension and fault-normal shortening within the panel. We use this method to calculate the kinematics of the central segment of the Garlock Fault, which cuts across the eastern California shear zone at a high angle. We obtain a sinistral slip rate of 6.1 ± 1.1 mm yr–1, comparable to geological evidence, but higher than most previous geodetic estimates, and a rotation rate of 4.0 ± 0.7° Myr–1 clockwise. The western Transverse Ranges transect a similar shear zone in coastal and offshore California, but at an angle of only 40°. As a result, the faults, which were sinistral when they were at a higher angle to the shear zone, have been reactivated in a dextral sense at a low rate, and the rate of rotation of the panel has decreased from its long-term rate of ∼5° to 1.6° ± 0.2° Myr–1 clockwise. These results help to resolve some of the apparent discrepancies between geological and geodetic slip-rate estimates, and provide an enhanced understanding of the mechanics of intracontinental transform systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Platt","given":"J.

We processed data from the ALOS satellite acquired before and after the collapse to quantify surface subsidence associated with the collapse to better understand the collapse process. The deformation shows a steep V-shaped pattern of subsidence with slight asymmetry. We compare the fit of four different models that simulate the subsidence pattern. The first two models use elastic half-space rheology. We find that collapse alone cannot explain the observations, and a component of normal faulting is required to fit the data. The second set of models simulates collapse in elasto-plastic media. Only a small component of normal faulting is required in these models. We suggest that considering elasto-plastic material behaviour is particularly important for shallow deformation modelling, where microfractures and other non-elastic rheology are common. Disregarding this material behaviour can lead to biased model parameter estimates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",3,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Plattner","given":"C."},{"family":"Wdowinski","given":"S."},{"family":"Dixon","given":"T.

This relatively new data source, which provides evidence of changes in subsurface magma storage and pressure without the need for ground-based equipment, has matured during the past decade. It now provides a means to address previously inaccessible questions and offers input to increasingly complex models of magmatic processes. Here, we review how technological advances in InSAR during 2010-2020 have facilitated our ability to monitor and interpret volcanic processes, primarily through rapid and accurate observations of the changing surfaces at active volcanoes worldwide. Specifically, we examine how current systems achieve excellent resolution in time and space, provide global coverage, and generate products that are easy to use by non-specialists—factors that have often limited the practical study of volcanoes using radar measurements. We also look to the future, offering our perspective about how advancements in technology and data management in the decade to come will increase the value and accessibility of InSAR applied to the geodetic study of volcanoes and monitoring of hazardous volcanic processes. New developments will include the launch of additional satellites by both public space agencies and private companies, as well as implementation of algorithms for exploiting the growing volumes of data. To meet their full potential, these efforts will require coordination between data users and data providers so that the relevant imagery is acquired, made available to volcanologists in a timely fashion, and utilized to assess and mitigate volcanic hazards.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Poland","given":"Michael P."},{"family":"Zebker","given":"Howard A."}],"citation-key":"Poland.Zebker_2022_VolcanoGeodesy","container-title":"Bulletin of Volcanology","container-title-short":"Bull Volcanol","DOI":"10.1007/s00445-022-01531-1","ISSN":"1432-0819","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,12]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC:00008","page":"27","source":"Springer Link","title":"Volcano geodesy using InSAR in 2020: the past and next decades","title-short":"Volcano geodesy using InSAR in 2020","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00445-022-01531-1","volume":"84"},

Using a fixed fault geometry, we compare the use of singular-value decomposition and constrained linear inversion to invert for the slip distribution and find that the latter approach is better resolved and more physically reasonable. Separate inversions using only GPS data, only InSAR data from descending orbits, and InSAR data from both ascending and descending orbits without the GPS data illustrate the complimentary nature of GPS and the presently available InSAR data. The GPS data resolve slip near GPS benchmarks well, while the InSAR provides greater spatial sampling. The combination of ascending and descending InSAR data contributes greatly to the ability of InSAR to resolve the slip model, thereby emphasizing the need to acquire this data for future earthquakes. The rake, distribution of slip and seismic moment of our preferred model are generally consistent with previous seismic and geodetic inversions, although significant differences do exist. GPS data projected in the radar line-of-sight (LOS) and corresponding InSAR pixels have a root mean square (rms) difference of about 3 cm. Comparison of our predictions of vertical displacement and observed uplift from corraline algae have an rms of 10 cm. Our inversion and previous results reveal that the location of slip might be influenced by the 1987 Mw= 7.5 event. Our analysis further reveals that the 1995 slip distribution was affected by a 1988 Mw= 7.2 event, and might have influenced a 1998 Mw= 7.0 earthquake that occurred downdip of the 1995 rupture. Our slip inversion reveals a potential change in mechanism in the southern portion of the rupture, consistent with seismic results. Predictions of the satellite LOS displacement from a seismic inversion and a joint seismic/GPS inversion do not compare favourably with the InSAR observations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Pritchard","given":"M.

  {"id":"Qiu.etal_2016_MechanismPartial","abstract":"Assessment of seismic hazard relies on estimates of how large an area of a tectonic fault could potentially rupture in a single earthquake. Vital information for these forecasts includes which areas of a fault are locked and how the fault is segmented. Much research has focused on exploring downdip limits to fault rupture from chemical and thermal boundaries, and along-strike barriers from subducted structural features, yet we regularly see only partial rupture of fully locked fault patches that could have ruptured as a whole in a larger earthquake. Here we draw insight into this conundrum from the 25 April 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha (Nepal) earthquake. We invert geodetic data with a structural model of the Main Himalayan thrust in the region of Kathmandu, Nepal, showing that this event was generated by rupture of a décollement bounded on all sides by more steeply dipping ramps. The morphological bounds explain why the event ruptured only a small piece of a large fully locked seismic gap. We then use dynamic earthquake cycle modeling on the same fault geometry to reveal that such events are predicted by the physics. Depending on the earthquake history and the details of rupture dynamics, however, great earthquakes that rupture the entire seismogenic zone are also possible. These insights from Nepal should be applicable to understanding bounds on earthquake size on megathrusts worldwide.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Qiu","given":"Qiang"},{"family":"Hill","given":"Emma M."},{"family":"Barbot","given":"Sylvain"},{"family":"Hubbard","given":"Judith"},{"family":"Feng","given":"Wanpeng"},{"family":"Lindsey","given":"Eric O."},{"family":"Feng","given":"Lujia"},{"family":"Dai","given":"Keren"},{"family":"Samsonov","given":"Sergey V."},{"family":"Tapponnier","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"Qiu.etal_2016_MechanismPartial","container-title":"Geology","container-title-short":"Geology","DOI":"10.1130/G38178.1","ISSN":"0091-7613","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",10,1]]},"page":"875-878","source":"Silverchair","title":"The mechanism of partial rupture of a locked megathrust: The role of fault morphology","title-short":"The mechanism of partial rupture of a locked megathrust","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1130/G38178.1","volume":"44"},
  {"id":"Radiguet.etal_2011_SpatialTemporal","abstract":"The Guerrero 2006 Slow Slip Event (SSE), Mexico, one of the world's largest observed SSEs, was recorded at 15 continuous GPS stations. This event provides the opportunity to analyse in detail the spatial and temporal evolution of slip at depth, and to constrain the characteristics of a large SSE. We perform an inversion in two steps. First, we invert the cumulative GPS displacements to retrieve the total slip amplitude. Second, we invert for the initiation time and duration of the slip, using a linearized least-squares inversion procedure and assuming a functional form for the slip function. Our results show that the slip is located on a patch of 300 km × 150 km (parallel and perpendicular to the coast, respectively), and extends from the bottom of the seismogenic zone to the transition zone. This slow slip event has an equivalent moment magnitude of 7.5. The maximum slip over a length scale of 25 km is 15 cm and the mean slip is 5.5 cm. Its lateral extension coincides with the segmentation of the subduction. Our inversion scheme allows us to analyse the spatial variability of the rise time, rupture velocity and slip function. We obtain a continuous image of the spatial and temporal variations of slip on the fault plane. The rupture initiated at a depth of 40 km (transition zone), in the western part of the Guerrero gap. The rupture then propagated from the western to the eastern part of the Guerrero segment with an average velocity of 0.8 km d−1. Our results show that a slip dislocation pulse, characterized by a symmetric ramp function, can model the 2006 SSE. The rise time (local duration of slip) does not show large spatial variations and is equal to about 185 d. The local slip duration is compared to the total duration (11–12 months) of the event, suggesting a large interaction of a large part of the fault during the dynamic process. We find that our inverted slip model is well resolved on the shallow part of the fault and in the central section of the fault.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Radiguet","given":"M."},{"family":"Cotton","given":"F."},{"family":"Vergnolle","given":"M."},{"family":"Campillo","given":"M."},{"family":"Valette","given":"B."},{"family":"Kostoglodov","given":"V."},{"family":"Cotte","given":"N."}],"citation-key":"Radiguet.etal_2011_SpatialTemporal","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","container-title-short":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2010.04866.x","ISSN":"0956-540X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",2,1]]},"page":"816-828","source":"Silverchair","title":"Spatial and temporal evolution of a long term slow slip event: the 2006 Guerrero Slow Slip Event","title-short":"Spatial and temporal evolution of a long term slow slip event","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2010.04866.x","volume":"184"},

However, the physical mechanisms that generate slow slip and the relationships with earthquakes are unclear. Slow slip events have been recorded in the Guerrero segment of the Cocos–North America subduction zone2,3. Here we use inversion of position time series recorded by a continuous GPS network to reconstruct the evolution of aseismic slip on the subduction interface of the Guerrero segment. We find that a slow slip event began in February 2014, two months before the magnitude (Mw) 7.3 Papanoa earthquake on 18 April. The slow slip event initiated in a region adjacent to the earthquake hypocentre and extended into the vicinity of the seismogenic zone. This spatio-temporal proximity strongly suggests that the Papanoa earthquake was triggered by the ongoing slow slip event. We demonstrate that the triggering mechanism could be either static stress increases in the hypocentral region, as revealed by Coulomb stress modelling, or enhanced weakening of the earthquake hypocentral area by the slow slip. We also show that the plate interface in the Guerrero area is highly coupled between slow slip events, and that most of the accumulated strain is released aseismically during the slow slip episodes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Radiguet","given":"M."},{"family":"Perfettini","given":"H."},{"family":"Cotte","given":"N."},{"family":"Gualandi","given":"A."},{"family":"Valette","given":"B."},{"family":"Kostoglodov","given":"V."},{"family":"Lhomme","given":"T."},{"family":"Walpersdorf","given":"A."},{"family":"Cabral Cano","given":"E."},{"family":"Campillo","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"Radiguet.etal_2016_Triggering2014","container-title":"Nature Geoscience","container-title-short":"Nature Geosci","DOI":"10.1038/ngeo2817","ISSN":"1752-0908","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",11]]},"language":"en","license":"2016 Nature Publishing Group","number":"11","page":"829-833","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Triggering of the 2014 Mw7.3 Papanoa earthquake by a slow slip event in Guerrero, Mexico","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo2817","volume":"9"},

The natural sciences and engineering are known to have many types of data that are sampled from infinite-dimensional function spaces, where classical finite-dimensional deep generative adversarial networks (GANs) may not be directly applicable. GANO generalizes the GAN framework and allows for the sampling of functions by learning push-forward operator maps in infinite-dimensional spaces. GANO consists of two main components, a generator neural operator and a discriminator neural functional. The inputs to the generator are samples of functions from a user-specified probability measure, e.g., Gaussian random field (GRF), and the generator outputs are synthetic data functions. The input to the discriminator is either a real or synthetic data function. In this work, we instantiate GANO using the Wasserstein criterion and show how the Wasserstein loss can be computed in infinite-dimensional spaces. We empirically study GANO in controlled cases where both input and output functions are samples from GRFs and compare its performance to the finite-dimensional counterpart GAN. We empirically study the efficacy of GANO on real-world function data of volcanic activities and show its superior performance over GAN.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Rahman","given":"Md Ashiqur"},{"family":"Florez","given":"Manuel A."},{"family":"Anandkumar","given":"Anima"},{"family":"Ross","given":"Zachary E."},{"family":"Azizzadenesheli","given":"Kamyar"}],"citation-key":"Rahman.etal_2022_GenerativeAdversarial","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2205.03017","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,12]]},"note":"ZSCC:00003","number":"arXiv:2205.03017","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Generative Adversarial Neural Operators","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03017"},

Here, we performed such a comparison for Egypt taking into account updated datasets of seismological and geodetic observations. In north-eastern Egypt, the stress field shows a fan-shaped azimuthal pattern with a WNW–ESE orientation on the Cairo region, which progressively rotated to NW–SE along the Gulf of Aqaba. The stress field shows a prevailing normal faulting regime, however, along the Sinai/Arabia plate boundary it coexists with a strike–slip faulting one (σ1 ≅ σ2 > σ3), while on the Gulf of Suez, it is characterized by crustal extension occurring on near-orthogonal directions (σ1 > σ2 ≅ σ3). On the Nile Delta, the maximum horizontal stress (SHmax) pattern shows scattered orientations, while on the Aswan region, it has a WNW–ESE strike with pure strike–slip features. The strain-rate field shows the largest values along the Red Sea and the Sinai/Arabia plate boundary. Crustal stretching (up to 40 nanostrain/yr) occurs on these areas with WSW–ENE and NE–SW orientations, while crustal contraction occurs on northern Nile Delta (10 nanostrain/yr) and offshore (~35 nanostrain/yr) with E–W and N–S orientations, respectively. The comparison between stress and strain orientations over the investigated area reveals that both patterns are near-parallel and driven by the same large-scale tectonic processes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Rashwan","given":"Mohamed"},{"family":"Sawires","given":"Rashad"},{"family":"Radwan","given":"Ali M."},{"family":"Sparacino","given":"Federica"},{"family":"Peláez","given":"José Antonio"},{"family":"Palano","given":"Mimmo"}],"citation-key":"Rashwan.etal_2021_CrustalStrain","container-title":"Remote Sensing","DOI":"10.3390/rs13071398","ISSN":"2072-4292","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","note":"ZSCC:00003","number":"7","page":"1398","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Crustal Strain and Stress Fields in Egypt from Geodetic and Seismological Data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/7/1398","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"Reilinger.McClusky_2011_NubiaArabiaEurasiaPlate","abstract":"We use geodetic and plate tectonic observations to constrain the tectonic evolution of the Nubia–Arabia–Eurasia plate system. Two phases of slowing of Nubia–Eurasia convergence, each of which resulted in an ∼50 per cent decrease in the rate of convergence, coincided with the initiation of Nubia–Arabia continental rifting along the Red Sea and Somalia–Arabia rifting along the Gulf of Aden at 24 ± 4 Ma, and the initiation of oceanic rifting along the full extent of the Gulf of Aden at 11 ± 2 Ma. In addition, both the northern and southern Red Sea (Nubia–Arabia plate boundary) underwent changes in the conﬁguration of extension at 11 ± 2 Ma, including the transfer of extension from the Suez Rift to the Gulf of Aqaba/Dead Sea fault system in the north, and from the central Red Sea Basin (Bab al Mandab) to the Afar volcanic zone in the south. While Nubia–Eurasia convergence slowed, the rate of Arabia–Eurasia convergence remained constant within the resolution of our observations, and is indistinguishable from the present-day global positioning system rate. The timing of the initial slowing of Nubia–Eurasia convergence (24 ± 4 Ma) corresponds to the initiation of extensional tectonics in the Mediterranean Basin, and the second phase of slowing to changes in the character of Mediterranean extension reported at ∼11 Ma. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that changes in Nubia–Eurasia convergence, and associated Nubia–Arabia divergence, are the fundamental cause of both Mediterranean and Middle East post-Late Oligocene tectonics. We speculate about the implications of these kinematic relationships for the dynamics of Nubia–Arabia–Eurasia plate interactions, and favour the interpretation that slowing of Nubia–Eurasia convergence, and the resulting tectonic changes in the Mediterranean Basin and Middle East, resulted from a decrease in slab pull from the Arabia-subducted lithosphere across the Nubia–Arabia, evolving plate boundary.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Reilinger","given":"Robert"},{"family":"McClusky","given":"Simon"}],"citation-key":"Reilinger.McClusky_2011_NubiaArabiaEurasiaPlate","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2011.05133.x","ISSN":"0956540X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",9]]},"language":"en","page":"971-979","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Nubia-Arabia-Eurasia plate motions and the dynamics of Mediterranean and Middle East tectonics: Mediterranean and Middle East geodynamics","title-short":"Nubia-Arabia-Eurasia plate motions and the dynamics of Mediterranean and Middle East tectonics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/gji/article-lookup/doi/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2011.05133.x","volume":"186"},
  {"id":"Ribot_2021_QuantificationTectonic","abstract":"The Levant Fault, also known as the Dead Sea Fault, is a left-lateral strike-slip fault of about 1200 km long. It extends from north to south, from the Taurus Mountains and the East Anatolian Fault system, to the northern termination of the extensive Red Sea system. The sinistral activity of the Levant Fault, linked to the northward displacement of the Arabian Plate relative to the Sinai sub-plate, is now well constrained with a slip rate of ∼ 5mm/yr and nearly 107 km of cumulative displacement over 20 My. However, the vertical component of this large fault system is still poorly defined. Based on the study of tectonic activity markers in the Gulf of Aqaba and the Strait of Tiran region, this work consists in constraining the architecture of the fault system in its southern termination. Using new high-resolution multibeam bathymetric data collected during two marine campaigns, we have thus defined a new fault model in the Gulf of Aqaba. The uplift of coral terraces to nearly 100 m above the mean sea level in the Gulf of Aqaba and up to 500 m on the Tiran island, reflects a significant vertical motion over the last few million years. The corals collected on these surfaces during a field trip in March 2017, and analyzed by Uranium-Thorium dating and Strontium isotopy, reveal an establishment of these coral terraces during the interglacial periods. These levels thus serve as temporal markers to constrain the vertical uplift generated by the faults. The precise location of the coral terraces, determined using Pleiades satellite images, allows us to understand how the tectonic activity is structured in the Gulf of Aqaba and the Strait of Tiran areas. By correcting the current elevation of the terraces with the eustatic data available in the literature, and by knowing precisely their ages of formation, we deduced the uplift rates of the eastern coast of the Gulf of Aqaba and along the Tiran island. The plift along the Gulf of Aqaba, estimated using the coral terraces, does not agree with the long-term uplift determined by thermochronology. Further analyses suggest that this uplift is distributed over the off-shore active structures, but also along the on-land structures which were previously considered inactive. This reactivation is due to the change in position of the Arabia-Sinai rotation pole there is 5 My ago. The conclusions of this work raises new questions as to how the deformation is distributed along this fault section before the change in position of the rotation pole, and how the system is connected to the triple junction Red Sea - Gulf of Suez - Gulf of Aqaba. Is the basin south of the Tiran island is the last pull-apart basin before connecting to the extensive system, or do additional steps, now masked by large evaporite deposits in the Red Sea, propagate further south before connecting to the extensive system?","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Ribot","given":"Matthieu"}],"citation-key":"Ribot_2021_QuantificationTectonic","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en+fr","number-of-pages":"281","publisher":"l’Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris","source":"Zotero","title":"Quantification of the tectonic uplift in the Gulf of Aqaba, Levant fault","type":"thesis","URL":"https://theses.hal.science/tel-03606348v1/document"},

The Gulf of Aqaba, which corresponds to the southern termination of the 1200-km-long Dead Sea fault system, remains one of the least known parts of this plate boundary fault, in large part due to its location offshore. Classically, the Gulf of Aqaba has been described as a succession of three pull-apart basins. Here, building on a new multibeam bathymetric survey of the Gulf of Aqaba, we provide details about the geometry of the faults at the bottom of the gulf that controls its morphology. In particular, we identify a 50-km-long fault section that shows evidence of recent activation. We associate this fault section (Aragonese fault) with the main fault section that ruptured during the 1995 magnitude Mw7.3 Nuweiba earthquake. In the southern part of the gulf, bathymetry emphasizes the strike-slip nature of the Arnona fault, while dip-slip motion seems to be accommodated mostly by faults located along the eastern edge of the gulf. Considering the simple linear geometry of the Arnona fault and the absence of any large earthquake for several centuries, despite an average slip-rate of ∼5 mm/yr, this fault should be considered as a significant candidate for an earthquake rupture of magnitude 7 or above in the near future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Ribot","given":"Matthieu"},{"family":"Klinger","given":"Yann"},{"family":"Jónsson","given":"Sigurjón"},{"family":"Avsar","given":"Ulas"},{"family":"Pons-Branchu","given":"Edwige"},{"family":"Matrau","given":"Rémi"},{"family":"Mallon","given":"Francis L."}],"citation-key":"Ribot.etal_2021_ActiveFaults","container-title":"Tectonics","DOI":"10.1029/2020TC006443","ISSN":"1944-9194","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"e2020TC006443","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Active Faults' Geometry in the Gulf of Aqaba, Southern Dead Sea Fault, Illuminated by Multibeam Bathymetric Data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020TC006443","volume":"40"},

  {"id":"Riel.etal_2014_DetectingTransient","abstract":"AbstractWe present a new method for automatically detecting transient deformation signals from geodetic time series. We cast the detection problem as a least squares procedure where the design matrix corresponds to a highly overcomplete, nonorthogonal dictionary of displacement functions in time that resemble transient signals of various timescales. The addition of a sparsity-inducing regularization term to the cost function limits the total number of dictionary elements needed to reconstruct the signal. Sparsity-inducing regularization enhances interpretability of the resultant time-dependent model by localizing the dominant timescales and onset times of the transient signals. Transient detection can then be performed using convex optimization software where detection sensitivity is dependent on the strength of the applied sparsity-inducing regularization. To assess uncertainties associated with estimation of the dictionary coefficients, we compare solutions with those found through a Bayesian inference approach to sample the full model space for each dictionary element. In addition to providing uncertainty bounds on the coefficients and confirming the optimization results, Bayesian sampling reveals trade-offs between dictionary elements that have nearly equal probability in modeling a transient signal. Thus, we can rigorously assess the probabilities of the occurrence of transient signals and their characteristic temporal evolution. The detection algorithm is applied on several synthetic time series and real observed GPS time series for the Cascadia region. For the latter data set, we incorporate a spatial weighting scheme that self-adjusts to the local network density and filters for spatially coherent signals. The weighting allows for the automatic detection of repeating slow slip events.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Riel","given":"Bryan"},{"family":"Simons","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Agram","given":"Piyush"},{"family":"Zhan","given":"Zhongwhen"}],"citation-key":"Riel.etal_2014_DetectingTransient","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1002/2014JB011077","ISSN":"2169-9356","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014"]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC:00044","page":"5140-5160","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Detecting transient signals in geodetic time series using sparse estimation techniques","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2014JB011077","volume":"119"},

  {"id":"Riel.etal_2018_QuantifyingGround","abstract":"We investigate complex surface deformation within the Los Angeles and Santa Ana Coastal Basins due to groundwater withdrawal and subsequent aquifer compaction/expansion. We analyze an 18 year interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series of 881 interferograms in conjunction with global positioning system (GPS) data within the groundwater basins. The large data set required the development of a distributed time series analysis framework able to automatically decompose both the InSAR and GPS time series into short-term and long-term signals. We find that short-term, seasonal oscillations of ground elevations due to annual groundwater withdrawal and recharge are unsteady due to changes in seasonal withdrawal by major water districts. The spatial pattern of seasonal ground deformation near the center of the basin corresponds to a diffusion process with peak deformation occurring at locations with highest groundwater production. Long-term signals occur over broader areas and are ultimately caused by long-term changes in groundwater production. Comparison of the geodetic data with hydraulic head data from major water districts suggests that different regions of the groundwater system are responsible for different temporal components in the observed ground deformation. Short-term, seasonal ground deformation is caused by compaction of shallower aquifers used for the majority of groundwater production whereas long-term ground deformation is correlated with delayed compaction of deeper aquifers and potential compressible clay layers. These results demonstrate the potential for geodetic analysis to be an important tool for groundwater management to maintain sustainable pumping practices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Riel","given":"Bryan"},{"family":"Simons","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Ponti","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Agram","given":"Piyush"},{"family":"Jolivet","given":"Romain"}],"citation-key":"Riel.etal_2018_QuantifyingGround","container-title":"Water Resources Research","DOI":"10.1029/2017WR021978","ISSN":"1944-7973","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC:00038","page":"3557-3582","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Quantifying Ground Deformation in the Los Angeles and Santa Ana Coastal Basins Due to Groundwater Withdrawal","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2017WR021978","volume":"54"},

  {"id":"Rivalta.etal_2015_ReviewMechanical","abstract":"Magma transport in brittle rock occurs by diking. Understanding the dynamics of diking and its observable consequences is essential to deciphering magma propagation in volcanic areas. Furthermore, diking plays a key role in tectonic phenomena such as continental rifting and plate divergence at mid-ocean ridges. Physics-based models of propagating dikes usually involve coupled transport of a viscous fluid with rock deformation and fracture. But the behavior of dikes is also affected by the exchange of heat with the surroundings and by the interaction with rock layering, pre-existing cracks, and the external stress field, among other factors. This complexity explains why existing models of propagating dikes are still relatively rudimentary: they are mainly 2D, and generally include only a subset of the factors described above. Here, we review numerical models on dike propagation focusing on the most recent studies (from the last 15 to 20years). We track the influence of two main philosophies, one in which fluid dynamics is taken to control the behavior and the other which focuses on rock fracturing. It appears that uncertainties in the way that rock properties such as fracture toughness vary from laboratory to field scale remain one of the critical issues to be resolved. Finally, we present promising directions of research that include emerging approaches to numerical modeling and insights from hydraulic fracturing as an industrial analog.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Rivalta","given":"E."},{"family":"Taisne","given":"B."},{"family":"Bunger","given":"A.

  {"id":"Roche.Druitt_2001_OnsetCaldera","abstract":"The rapid depressurisation and discharge of volatile rich silicic magma chamber and the onset of caldera collapse associated with ignimbrite eruption is investigated using combined theoretical and experimental approaches. We first present a scaling analysis of the force balance on the roof of a depressurising magma chamber. This provides a failure criterion for the chamber roof and shows that the chamber underpressure required to trigger coherent (piston) collapse along a vertical or steeply outward dipping reverse ring fault increases with the roof aspect ratio (R = thickness/width). The failure criterion is validated by a series of experiments that reveal a transition, with increasing roof aspect ratio, from piston collapse to either (1) no collapse (low reservoir underpressure) or (2) non-coherent collapse (high reservoir underpressure). Then, taking into account the failure criterion obtained with the scaling analysis, a theoretical model allows calculation of the erupted chamber volume fraction required to trigger caldera collapse. We consider a two stage model, with an initially overpressured chamber that becomes progressively underpressured as the eruption proceeds. The main input parameters are the chamber depth, vertical extent and ellipticity in plan view, the magma water content, the cohesion and coefficient of internal friction of the roof, and the ring fault dip. In the case of a mechanically homogeneous roof and a single, large and rapid eruption, the erupted volume fraction required to trigger piston collapse increases with the roof aspect ratio until the chamber is totally emptied (before initiation of any collapse) at RW1^1.4, the exact value depending mainly on the ring fault dip and to a lesser extent on the coefficient of internal friction of the roof. As shown by experiments, collapse into reservoirs with R s 1^1.4 probably cannot collapse as a piston and, if a surface caldera forms at all, collapse is more likely to occur non-coherently. Data for the onset of caldera collapse during seven well documented major ignimbrite eruptions are in broad agreement with the model. ß 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

  {"id":"Roche.etal_2000_ExperimentalStudy","abstract":"Scaled experiments have been carried out on caldera collapse mechanisms, using silicone as analogue magma and dry sand as analogue rock. Experiments were carried out in two and three dimensions using a range of roof aspect ratios (thickness/width 0.2 to 4.5) appropriate for caldera collapse. They reveal a general mechanism of collapse, only weakly dependent on the shape of the reservoir. For low roof aspect ratios (≤1), subsidence starts by flexure of the roof and the formation of outward dipping, reverse ring faults, which in turn trigger formation of peripheral inward dipping, normal ring faults. The subsidence always occurs asymmetrically. In cross section the reverse faults delimit a coherent piston, bounded on each side by an annular zone of inwardly tilted strata located between the reverse and normal ring fault sets. The surface depression consists of a nondeformed area (piston) surrounded by an annular extensional zone (tilted strata). For high aspect ratios (>1), multiple reverse faults break up the roof into large pieces, and subsidence occurred as a series of nested wedges (2?D) or cones (3?D). The extensional zone dominates the surface depression. In the case where preexisting regional faults do not play a major role, the collapse mechanics of calderas probably depends strongly on the roof aspect ratio. Calderas with low roof aspect ratios are predicted to collapse as coherent pistons along reverse faults. The annular extensional zone might be the source of the large landslides that generate intracaldera megabreccias. Collapse into magma reservoirs with high roof aspect ratios may be the origin of some funnel calderas where explosive reaming is not dominant.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Roche","given":"O."},{"family":"Druitt","given":"T.

  {"id":"Roche.etal_2001_SubsurfaceStructures","abstract":"Summit pit craters are found in many types of volcanoes and are generally thought to be the product of collapse into an underpressured reservoir caused by magma withdrawal. We investigate the mechanisms and structures associated with summit pit crater formation by scaled analogue experiments and make comparisons with natural examples. Models use a sand plaster mixture as analogue rock over a cylinder of silicone simulating an underpressured magma reservoir. Experiments are carried out using different roof aspect ratios (roof thickness/roof width) of 0.2±2. They reveal two basic collapse mechanisms, dependant on the roof aspect ratio. One occurs at low aspect ratios (#1), as illustrated by aspect ratios of 0.2 and 1. Outward dipping reverse faults initiated at the silicone margins propagates through the entire roof thickness and cause subsidence of a coherent block. Collapse along the reverse faults is accommodated by marginal ¯exure of the block and tension fractures at the surface (aspect ratio of 0.2) or by the creation of inward dipping normal faults delimiting a terrace (aspect ratio of 1). At an aspect ratio of 1, overhanging pit walls are the surface expressions of the reverse faults. Experiments at high aspect ratio (.1.2) reveal a second mechanism. In this case, collapse occurs by stopping, which propagates upwards by a complex pattern of both reverse faults and tension fractures. The initial underground collapse is restricted to a zone above the reservoir and creates a cavity with a stable roof above it. An intermediate mechanism occurs at aspect ratios of 1.1±1.2. In this case, stopping leads to the formation of a cavity with a thin and unstable roof, which collapses suddenly. The newly formed depression then exhibits overhanging walls. Surface morphology and structure of natural examples, such as the summit pit craters at Masaya Volcano, Nicaragua, have many of the features created in the models, indicating that the internal structural geometry of experiments can be applied to real examples. In particular, the surface area and depth of the underpressured reservoir can be roughly estimated. We present a morphological analysis of summit pit craters at volcanoes such as Kilimanjaro (Tanzania), San Cristobal, Telica and Masaya (Nicaragua), and Ubinas (Peru), and indicate a likely type of subsidence and possible position of the former magma reservoir responsible for collapse in each case. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

To this purpose, we used data from the earthquake catalog reported by the Servicio Sismologico Nacional (1988–2016). We investigate depth variations of the b-value for the Cocos and Rivera under North American plates interface, by a detailed analysis of 15 cross-sections. The obtained b-value proﬁles vary from 0.50 to 2.50, which nevertheless appear related to the faulting style and stress state. By comparing the locations and focal mechanism of the largest events with the b-values of the surrounding regions, our analysis corroborates the dependence of the b-value on the faulting style. Thrust events occur in regions of low and high b-value at depths < 50 km. Normal-faulting events occur mainly in high b-value regions at all shallow (Z < 30 km) and intermediate depths (Z > 30 km), in agreement with global studies. These results support the hypothesis that diﬀerential stress processes may be behind the occurrence of the diﬀerent faulting style. On the contrary, by analyzing the mean b-values for both types of faulting mechanism at each of the cross-sections, we found a signiﬁcantly lower mean b-value related to normal faulting for those regions where the 8 (Mw 8.2) and 19 (Mw 7.1) September 2017 earthquakes occur. These results lead us to conclude that those regions experienced an increased stress state prone to the occurrence of normal-intraplate events. We also compare the b-value distribution with Vp and Q tomography studies obtaining a good correlation between them. We found evidence to relate b-value variations with subduction processes such as stress state due to tectonic and ﬂexural conditions, and to a lesser extent to material heterogeneity and ﬂuid dehydration.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Rodríguez-Pérez","given":"Quetzalcoatl"},{"family":"Zuñiga","given":"F.

  {"id":"Roland.McGuire_2009_EarthquakeSwarms","abstract":"Swarm-like earthquake sequences are commonly observed in a diverse range of geological settings including volcanic and geothermal regions as well as along transform plate boundaries. They typically lack a clear mainshock, cover an unusually large spatial area relative to their total seismic moment release, and fail to decay in time according to standard aftershock scaling laws. Swarms often result from a clear driving phenomenon, such as a magma intrusion, but most lack the necessary geophysical data to constrain their driving process. To identify the mechanisms that cause swarms on strike-slip faults, we use relative earthquake locations to quantify the spatial and temporal characteristics of swarms along Southern California and East Paciﬁc Rise transform faults. Swarms in these regions exhibit distinctive characteristics, including a relatively narrow range of hypocentral migration velocities, on the order of a kilometre per hour. This rate corresponds to the rupture propagation velocity of shallow creep transients that are sometimes observed geodetically in conjunction with swarms, and is signiﬁcantly faster than the earthquake migration rates typically associated with ﬂuid diffusion. The uniformity of migration rates and low effective stress drops observed here suggest that shallow aseismic creep transients are the primary process driving swarms on strike-slip faults. Moreover, the migration rates are consistent with laboratory values of the rate-state friction parameter b (0.01) as long as the Salton Trough faults fail under hydrostatic conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Roland","given":"Emily"},{"family":"McGuire","given":"Jeffrey J."}],"citation-key":"Roland.McGuire_2009_EarthquakeSwarms","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2009.04214.x","ISSN":"0956540X, 1365246X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",9]]},"language":"en","page":"1677-1690","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Earthquake swarms on transform faults","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/gji/article-lookup/doi/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2009.04214.x","volume":"178"},

  {"id":"Rollins.etal_2015_PostseismicDeformation","abstract":"Due to its location on a transtensional section of the Pacific-North American plate boundary, the Salton Trough is a region featuring large strike-slip earthquakes within a regime of shallow asthenosphere, high heat flow, and complex faulting, and so postseismic deformation there may feature enhanced viscoelastic relaxation and afterslip that is particularly detectable at the surface. The 2010 $$M = 7.2$$El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake was the largest shock in the Salton Trough since 1892 and occurred close to the US-Mexico border, and so the postseismic deformation recorded by the continuous GPS network of southern California provides an opportunity to study the rheology of this region. Three-year postseismic transients extracted from GPS displacement time-series show four key features: (1) 1–2 cm of cumulative uplift in the Imperial Valley and $$\\sim$$1 cm of subsidence in the Peninsular Ranges, (2) relatively large cumulative horizontal displacements $$>$$150 km from the rupture in the Peninsular Ranges, (3) rapidly decaying horizontal displacement rates in the first few months after the earthquake in the Imperial Valley, and (4) sustained horizontal velocities, following the rapid early motions, that were still visibly ongoing 3 years after the earthquake. Kinematic inversions show that the cumulative 3-year postseismic displacement field can be well fit by afterslip on and below the coseismic rupture, though these solutions require afterslip with a total moment equivalent to at least a $$M = 7.2$$earthquake and higher slip magnitudes than those predicted by coseismic stress changes. Forward modeling shows that stress-driven afterslip and viscoelastic relaxation in various configurations within the lithosphere can reproduce the early and later horizontal velocities in the Imperial Valley, while Newtonian viscoelastic relaxation in the asthenosphere can reproduce the uplift in the Imperial Valley and the subsidence and large westward displacements in the Peninsular Ranges. We present two forward models of dynamically coupled deformation mechanisms that fit the postseismic transient well: a model combining afterslip in the lower crust, Newtonian viscoelastic relaxation in a localized zone in the lower crust beneath areas of high heat flow and geothermal activity, and Newtonian viscoelastic relaxation in the asthenosphere; and a second model that replaces the afterslip in the first model with viscoelastic relaxation with a stress-dependent viscosity in the mantle. The rheology of this high-heat-flow, high-strain-rate region may incorporate elements of both these models and may well be more complex than either of them.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Rollins","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Barbot","given":"Sylvain"},{"family":"Avouac","given":"Jean-Philippe"}],"citation-key":"Rollins.etal_2015_PostseismicDeformation","container-title":"Pure and Applied Geophysics","container-title-short":"Pure Appl.

  {"id":"Rollins.etal_2018_InterseismicStrain","abstract":"Geodetic data show that the Los Angeles metropolitan area is undergoing 8–9 mm/year of north-south tectonic shortening associated with the Big Bend of the San Andreas Fault. This shortening has been linked to multiple damaging twentieth century thrust earthquakes as well as possible Mw ≥ 7.0 Holocene thrust events beneath central Los Angeles. To better characterize this seismic hazard, we assess how this shortening is being accommodated by interseismic strain accumulation on subsurface faults, incorporating detailed seismology- and geology-based models of fault geometry and the low-stiffness Los Angeles sedimentary basin. We find that strain accumulation on local strike-slip faults likely contributes no more than 1–2 mm/year of the shortening. We formally invert the geodetic data for the pattern of interseismic strain accumulation on the north dipping Sierra Madre, Puente Hills, and Compton thrust faults and a master decollement. We explore the impact of the assumed material model, strain accumulation on faults to the west and east, and other model assumptions. We infer that the three faults slip at 3–4 mm/year over the long term and are currently partially or fully locked and accruing interseismic strain on their upper sections. This locking implies an annual deficit of seismic moment, 1.6 + 1.3/−0.5 × 1017 Nm/year in total, which is presumably balanced over the long-term average by the moment released in earthquakes.

  {"id":"Roobol.Stewart_2019_CenozoicFaults","abstract":"Following the November 1995 earthquake in the Gulf of Aqaba that affected countries in the area including northwest Saudi Arabia, a study was made to identify the youngest geological faults in the area. These faults have been termed Cenozoic faults, although most are Neogene in age, being younger than 23 Ma. A number of previously unknown structures have been identified. These include a zone of shattered and intensely faulted rocks 25 km wide that extends inland into Saudi Arabia from the coast of the Gulf of Aqaba. In this zone, shattered granite intrusions are eroded in a similar manner to sandstone and produce deep, vertical walled, narrow gorges, such as Tayyib al Ism. Faults parallel to the Gulf of Aqaba occur as deep wadis where the geological contacts are offset by sinistral displacements of up to 9 km, and show systematic shoulder uplift away from the gulf. Another major Cenozoic structure contained within the Saudi Arabian side of the Gulf of Aqaba is a major fold that extends 50 km inland from the coast. In this fold the Precambrian lithologic units, dikes and faults are rotated 90 degrees anticlockwise with the appearance of a drag fold due to the approximately 115 km sinistral offset of the Gulf of Aqaba. This structure is not repeated in Sinai and occurs only on the Arabian side of the Gulf. It is interpreted not as a drag fold but as a fold that probably resulted from the initial displacement along the Arabian Plate from Sinai. Later faults isolated the structure within Saudi Arabia. Reactivated Precambrian faults within the structure are also curved. Aeromagnetic anomalies show that the traces of major Tertiary gabbro dikes that parallel the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia are also curved within the fold, but their curvature of about 45 degrees anticlockwise is less than that of the Precambrian rocks and dikes, which suggests dike emplacement occurred after folding commenced. Maps that cover an area 550 km east-west by 360 km north-south and include the Gulf of Aqaba and adjacent areas show the whole area to be cut by thousands of Cenozoic faults (about two and a half thousand of the larger faults are shown here). The oldest faults occur in a 250-km wide belt of pre-rift structures that include graben structures that lie to the east of the Gulf of Aqaba fault system. These faults are oriented north-northwest in the north and curve to the northwest in the south of the study area, and are named Ribbon faults because they divide the country rocks into long thin strips from 100 to 500 m wide. These faults mainly occur within Paleozoic sandstone where they are preserved as walls cemented by iron oxides/hydroxides. Where the Ribbon faults occur within Precambrian Shield and Tertiary sediments the oxide/hydroxide fills are absent. The Ribbon faults result from crustal extension as they form horst-graben structures with topography of a few metres. In some areas open fissures occur without apparent displacement. The aeromagnetic maps show that some of the major graben structures are underlain by large Tertiary gabbro dikes. The system is mainly seismically inactive today with a few local exceptions, such as a cluster of earthquake activity about 75 km southeast of Tabuk city. Most active are the north-south to north-northeast-trending Gulf of Aqaba system of faults that include those of the floor of the Gulf of Aqaba. Other notable fault systems in the area are a prominent set of pre-rift east–west faults, some of which contain traces of Tertiary gabbro dikes and some of which become curved toward the Gulf of Aqaba like the reactivated Precambrian faults. The map area preserves a record of about 25 million years of faulting that commenced in pre-Red Sea rift time, and also records the initiation of separation of the Arabian Plate from Sinai by fold deformation prior to faulting. Some minor folding occurs from drag and compression of a belt of Tertiary sedimentary rocks originally continuous with the Gulf of Suez which were transported 115 km into the Gulf of Aqaba. The Gulf of Aqaba region remains the most active seismic area in Saudi Arabia and is the site of three large earthquakes in 1983, 1993 and 1995.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Roobol","given":"M.

  {"id":"Rosen.etal_2012_InSARScientific","abstract":"We have developed a flexible and extensible Interferometric SAR (InSAR) Scientific Computing Environment (ISCE) for geodetic image processing. ISCE was designed from the ground up as a geophysics community tool for generating stacks of interferograms that lend themselves to various forms of time-series analysis, with attention paid to accuracy, extensibility, and modularity. The framework is python-based, with code elements rigorously componentized by separating input/output operations from the processing engines. This allows greater flexibility and extensibility in the data models, and creates algorithmic code that is less susceptible to unnecessary modification when new data types and sensors are available. In addition, the components support provenance and checkpointing to facilitate reprocessing and algorithm exploration. The algorithms, based on legacy processing codes, have been adapted to assume a common reference track approach for all images acquired from nearby orbits, simplifying and systematizing the geometry for time-series analysis. The framework is designed to easily allow user contributions, and is distributed for free use by researchers. ISCE can process data from the ALOS, ERS, EnviSAT, Cosmo-SkyMed, RadarSAT-1, RadarSAT-2, and TerraSAR-X platforms, starting from Level-0 or Level 1 as provided from the data source, and going as far as Level 3 geocoded deformation products. With its flexible design, it can be extended with raw/meta data parsers to enable it to work with radar data from other platforms.","author":[{"family":"Rosen","given":"Paul A."},{"family":"Gurrola","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Sacco","given":"Gian Franco"},{"family":"Zebker","given":"Howard"}],"citation-key":"Rosen.etal_2012_InSARScientific","container-title":"EUSAR 2012; 9th European Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar","event-title":"EUSAR 2012; 9th European Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",4]]},"page":"730-733","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"The InSAR scientific computing environment","type":"paper-conference"},

Moment magnitude Mw values, derived from the spectra and the scaling relation of Hanks & Kanamori, follow a Gutenberg–Richter distribution with a larger b-value (1.22) from that associated with the ML values (0.93) for the same earthquakes. The completeness magnitude for the Mw values is 1.6 while for ML it is 1.0. The quantity (Mw − ML) linearly increases in the analysed magnitude range as ML decreases.

Here we analyze a vigorous aftershock sequence and postseismic geodetic strain that occurred in the Yuha Desert following the 2010 Mw 7.2 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake. About 155,000 detected aftershocks occurred in a network of orthogonal faults and exhibit features of two distinct mechanisms for aftershock triggering. The earliest aftershocks were likely driven by afterslip that spread away from the main shock with the logarithm of time. A later pulse of aftershocks swept again across the Yuha Desert with square root time dependence and swarm-like behavior; together with local geological evidence for hydrothermalism, these features suggest that the events were driven by ﬂuid diffusion. The observations illustrate how multiple driving mechanisms and the underlying fault structure jointly control the evolution of an aftershock sequence.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Ross","given":"Zachary E."},{"family":"Rollins","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Cochran","given":"Elizabeth S."},{"family":"Hauksson","given":"Egill"},{"family":"Avouac","given":"Jean-Philippe"},{"family":"Ben-Zion","given":"Yehuda"}],"citation-key":"Ross.etal_2017_AftershocksDriven","container-title":"Geophysical Research Letters","container-title-short":"Geophys.

  {"id":"Ross.etal_2018_GeneralizedSeismic","abstract":"To optimally monitor earthquake-generating processes, seismologists have sought to lower detection sensitivities ever since instrumental seismic networks were started about a century ago. Recently, it has become possible to search continuous waveform archives for replicas of previously recorded events (i.e., template matching), which has led to at least an order of magnitude increase in the number of detected earthquakes and greatly sharpened our view of geological structures. Earthquake catalogs produced in this fashion, however, are heavily biased in that they are completely blind to events for which no templates are available, such as in previously quiet regions or for very large-magnitude events. Here, we show that with deep learning, we can overcome such biases without sacrificing detection sensitivity. We trained a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) on the vast hand-labeled data archives of the Southern California Seismic Network to detect seismic body-wave phases. We show that the ConvNet is extremely sensitive and robust in detecting phases even when masked by high background noise and when the ConvNet is applied to new data that are not represented in the training set (in particular, very largemagnitude events). This generalized phase detection framework will significantly improve earthquake monitoring and catalogs, which form the underlying basis for a wide range of basic and applied seismological research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Ross","given":"Zachary E."},{"family":"Meier","given":"Men‐Andrin"},{"family":"Hauksson","given":"Egill"},{"family":"Heaton","given":"Thomas H."}],"citation-key":"Ross.etal_2018_GeneralizedSeismic","container-title":"Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America","DOI":"10.1785/0120180080","ISSN":"0037-1106, 1943-3573","issue":"5A","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10]]},"language":"en","page":"2894-2901","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Generalized Seismic Phase Detection with Deep Learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ssa/bssa/article/108/5A/2894/546740/Generalized-Seismic-Phase-Detection-with-Deep","volume":"108"},

  {"id":"Ross.etal_2019_PhaseLinkDeep","abstract":"Seismic phase association is a fundamental task in seismology that pertains to linking together phase detections on different sensors that originate from a common earthquake. It is widely employed to detect earthquakes on permanent and temporary seismic networks and underlies most seismicity catalogs produced around the world. This task can be challenging because the number of sources is unknown, events frequently overlap in time, or can occur simultaneously in different parts of a network. We present PhaseLink, a framework based on recent advances in deep learning for grid-free earthquake phase association. Our approach learns to link phases together that share a common origin and is trained entirely on millions of synthetic sequences of P and S wave arrival times generated using a 1-D velocity model. Our approach is simple to implement for any tectonic regime, suitable for real-time processing, and can naturally incorporate errors in arrival time picks. Rather than tuning a set of ad hoc hyperparameters to improve performance, PhaseLink can be improved by simply adding examples of problematic cases to the training data set. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of PhaseLink on a challenging sequence from southern California and synthesized sequences from Japan designed to test the point at which the method fails. For the examined data sets, PhaseLink can precisely associate phases to events that occur only ∼12 s apart in origin time. This approach is expected to improve the resolution of seismicity catalogs, add stability to real-time seismic monitoring, and streamline automated processing of large seismic data sets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Ross","given":"Zachary E."},{"family":"Yue","given":"Yisong"},{"family":"Meier","given":"Men‐Andrin"},{"family":"Hauksson","given":"Egill"},{"family":"Heaton","given":"Thomas H."}],"citation-key":"Ross.etal_2019_PhaseLinkDeep","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","container-title-short":"J.

Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), by enabling measurement of ground deformation at a global scale every few days, may hold the key to those interactions. However, atmospheric propagation delays often exceed ground deformation of interest despite state-of-the art processing, and thus InSAR analysis requires expert interpretation and a priori knowledge of fault systems, precluding global investigations of deformation dynamics. Here, we show that a deep auto-encoder architecture tailored to untangle ground deformation from noise in InSAR time series autonomously extracts deformation signals, without prior knowledge of a fault’s location or slip behaviour. Applied to InSAR data over the North Anatolian Fault, our method reaches 2 mm detection, revealing a slow earthquake twice as extensive as previously recognized.

Calderas are the most notable type of vertical collapse, on the summit of volcanoes. Caldera collapse has been observed and monitored only at Miyakejima (Japan; 2000), Dolomieu (Reunion; 2007) and Fernandina (Galapagos; 1968), highlighting our limited knowledge on its kinematic behavior. Here we use experimental models to investigate the kinematic evolution of calderas and vertical collapses in general. We extract velocity and strain fields using the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique, generating time series. Experimental vertical collapses undergoing constant subsidence velocity show three main kinematic behaviors: (1) continuous collapse, whose velocity is similar to the source subsidence velocity; (2) incremental collapse, with episodic (stepwise) accelerations along pre?existing ring structures; (3) sudden collapse, resulting from the upward migration of a cavity, only for T/D > 2 (T and D are the depth and width of the magma chamber, respectively) and without ring structures. The velocity in the collapsing column may increase up to four orders of magnitude with regard to the constant subsidence velocity of the source. Comparison to nature suggests that: (1) there are close kinematic similarities with monitored collapse calderas, explaining their incremental subsidence after the development of ring structures; (2) sudden pit crater formation is induced by the upward propagation of cavities, due to magma removal at depth and in absence of ring structures; (3) all these types of vertical collapses have a consistent mechanism of formation and kinematic behavior, function of T/D and the presence/absence of ring structures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Ruch","given":"Joel"},{"family":"Acocella","given":"V."},{"family":"Geshi","given":"N."},{"family":"Nobile","given":"A."},{"family":"Corbi","given":"F."}],"citation-key":"Ruch.etal_2012_KinematicAnalysis","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","container-title-short":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/2012JB009229","ISSN":"0148-0227","issue":"B7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",7,4]]},"source":"agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com (Atypon)","title":"Kinematic analysis of vertical collapse on volcanoes using experimental models time series","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2012JB009229","volume":"117"},

Many of the earthquake swarms were clearly associated with rifting events, consisting of magmatic intrusions, surface faulting, and in some cases volcanic eruptions. Together, the swarms suggest that extension at these divergent plate boundaries occurs episodically along <100 km long segments, some of which were previously unrecognized. Within the study region, the Gulf of Aden shows the most frequent swarm activity, followed by Afar and then the southern Red Sea. The results show that the three areas were subject to an increase of earthquake-swarm activity from 2003 to 2013 in the form of three rifting episodes and at least seven volcanic eruptions. We interpret that the most likely controls on temporal variations in earthquake swarm activity are either temporal variations in magma supply, or rifting-induced stress change that trigger clusters of swarms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Ruch","given":"Joël"},{"family":"Keir","given":"Derek"},{"family":"Passarelli","given":"Luigi"},{"family":"Di Giacomo","given":"Domenico"},{"family":"Ogubazghi","given":"Ghebrebrhan"},{"family":"Jónsson","given":"Sigurjón"}],"citation-key":"Ruch.etal_2021_Revealing60","container-title":"Frontiers in Earth Science","DOI":"10.3389/feart.2021.664673","ISSN":"2296-6463","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"page":"690","source":"Frontiers","title":"Revealing 60 years of Earthquake Swarms in the Southern Red Sea, Afar and the Gulf of Aden","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/feart.2021.664673","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"Ryder.Burgmann_2008_SpatialVariations","abstract":"We use ERS InSAR measurements to record spatial variations in creep rate along the creeping segment of the San Andreas Fault (SAF), California, between 1992 and 2001. Inversion of geodetic data yields a slip rate distribution along the creeping segment, which is used for ﬁrstorder moment release and deﬁcit calculations. We present a time-averaged spatial picture of surface deformation and associated subsurface creep. An interferometric stack is constructed from 12 interferograms that show good coherence. For the decade of observation, the total right-lateral offset spanned by the data is ∼34 mm yr−1. Along most of the length of the creeping segment, this offset occurs within a narrow (<2 km) zone close to the fault trace. In the northern part, a minor part of the offset is taken up by the nearby Calaveras-Paicines Fault. In general, the observed rates of surface creep are consistent with those obtained by several other studies for a longer and/or earlier period of time, using different geodetic methods. This suggests that the average creep rate has been constant over a period of almost four decades. A joint GPS-InSAR inversion implies that the shallow creep rate is variable along strike, reaching up to 31.5 ± 1 mm yr−1 in the central section of the creeping segment, tapering off along-strike to the south and becoming partitioned across two subparallel faults in the north. The deep slip rate beneath the seismogenic layer is 33 ± 3 mm yr−1. The difference between shallow and deep slip rates suggests that there is a shallow slip deﬁcit on the creeping segment of the SAF (CSAF). Moment release rate due to aseismic slip is approximately three orders of magnitude greater than seismic moment release. The annual creep on the CSAF is equivalent to the moment released in a M 6 earthquake. The equivalent moment of the slip deﬁcit relative to the deep slip rate is between 4.1 × 1017 and 8.4 × 1017 N m yr−1, which is equivalent to a magnitude 5.7–5.9 earthquake. Over a 150 yr period, the deﬁcit is equivalent to a M 7.2–7.4 earthquake. This slip deﬁcit may be compensated by intermittent moderate sized events or by accelerated afterslip following large events on nearby fault segments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Ryder","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Bürgmann","given":"Roland"}],"citation-key":"Ryder.Burgmann_2008_SpatialVariations","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2008.03938.x","ISSN":"0956540X, 1365246X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",12]]},"language":"en","page":"837-852","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Spatial variations in slip deficit on the central San Andreas Fault from InSAR","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/gji/article-lookup/doi/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2008.03938.x","volume":"175"},

The former is an active left lateral transform, bounding the Arabian plate and the Sinai sub-plate, and the latter branches out of the former and separates the Sinai sub-plate into two tectonic domains. In this study we obtain the velocities of 33 permanent GPS stations and 145 survey stations that were surveyed in three campaigns between 1996 and 2008. We use a simple 1-D elastic dislocation model to infer the slip rate and locking depth along various segments of the DST. We infer a 3.1–4.5 mm/yr slip rate and a 7.8–16.5 km locking depth along the DST north of the CFS, and a slip rate of 4.6–5.9 mm/yr and locking depth of 11.8–24 km along the Jericho Valley, south of the CFS. Further south, along the Arava Valley we obtain a slip rate of 4.7–5.4 mm/yr and a locking depth of 12.1–23 km. We identify an oblique motion along the Carmel Fault with ∼0.7 mm/yr left-lateral and ∼0.6 mm/yr extension rates, resulting in N-S extension across the Carmel Fault. This result, together with the decrease in DST slip velocity from the Jericho Valley to the segment north of the CFS, confirms previous suggestions, according to which part of the slip between Arabia and Sinai is being transferred from the DST to the CFS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Sadeh","given":"M."},{"family":"Hamiel","given":"Y."},{"family":"Ziv","given":"A."},{"family":"Bock","given":"Y."},{"family":"Fang","given":"P."},{"family":"Wdowinski","given":"S."}],"citation-key":"Sadeh.etal_2012_CrustalDeformation","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/2012JB009241","ISSN":"2156-2202","issue":"B8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"en","license":"©2012.

To decipher the ground deformation in response to hydrological mass variations of the Himalaya and North India, we analyzed continuous Global Positioning System (cGPS) observations from 50 sites together with Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data for the period 2004–2015. Vertical components of surface deformation derived from GPS and GRACE show moderate to high-level amplitude correlation with a slope value of 0.76 and a level of phase delay from ±25° to ±30°. The average weighted root-mean-square reduction (WRMS) of 17.72% suggests the prominence of hydrological mass variations particularly over the sub-Himalaya and Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP). GPS-derived vertical deformation after correcting the hydrological effects utilizing GRACE observations suggests that the sub-Himalaya and IGP are undergoing subsidence and the surrounding areas show uplift. In addition to the tectonic and nontectonic forcings, an unsustainable consumption of groundwater associated to irrigation and other anthropogenic uses influence the subsidence rate in the IGP and sub-Himalaya. Further, 2-D elastic dislocation modeling suggests that GRACE correction to the GPS vertical velocity causes a reduction in the subsurface slip rate estimation over the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT) system by 12.06% and improves the chi-square misfit by 20.32%.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Saji","given":"Ajish P."},{"family":"Sunil","given":"P.

  {"id":"Sandanbata.Saito_2024_QuantifyingMagma","abstract":"Submarine volcano monitoring is vital for assessing volcanic hazards but challenging in remote and inaccessible environments. In the vicinity of Kita-Ioto Island, south of Japan, unusual M ∼ 5 non-double-couple volcanic earthquakes exhibited quasi-regular recurrence near a submarine caldera. Following the earthquakes in 2008 and 2015, a distant ocean bottom pressure sensor recorded distinct tsunami signals. In this study, we aim to find a source model of the tsunami-generating earthquake and quantify the pre-seismic magma overpressure within the caldera's magma reservoir. Based on the earthquake's characteristic focal mechanism and efficient tsunami generation, we hypothesize that submarine trapdoor faulting occurred due to highly pressurized magma. To investigate this hypothesis, we establish mechanical earthquake models that link pre-seismic magma overpressure to the size of the resulting trapdoor faulting, by considering stress interaction between a ring-fault system and a reservoir of the caldera. The trapdoor faulting with large fault slip due to magma-induced shear stress in the submarine caldera reproduces well the observed tsunami waveform. Due to limited data, uncertainties in the fault geometry persist, leading to variations of magma overpressure estimation: the pre-seismic magma overpressure ranging approximately from 5 to 20 MPa, and the co-seismic pressure drop ratio from 10% to 40%. Although better constraints on the fault geometry are required for robust magma pressure quantification, this study shows that magmatic systems beneath calderas are influenced significantly by intra-caldera fault systems and that tsunamigenic trapdoor faulting provides rare opportunities to obtain quantitative insights into remote submarine volcanism hidden under the ocean.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Sandanbata","given":"Osamu"},{"family":"Saito","given":"Tatsuhiko"}],"citation-key":"Sandanbata.Saito_2024_QuantifyingMagma","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/2023JB027917","ISSN":"2169-9356","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"en","page":"e2023JB027917","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Quantifying Magma Overpressure Beneath a Submarine Caldera: A Mechanical Modeling Approach to Tsunamigenic Trapdoor Faulting Near Kita-Ioto Island, Japan","title-short":"Quantifying Magma Overpressure Beneath a Submarine Caldera","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2023JB027917","volume":"129"},

  {"id":"Saunders_2001_ShallowPlumbing","abstract":". The floor of Rabaul caldera experiences complex deformation as revealed both in the geological and historical record, as well as through recent systematic monitoring. The observed deformation pattern has been modelled previously as being caused by tumescent strain above one or more point sources at shallow levels within the caldera block, or as a response of the caldera structure to deeper sources of deformation. Here, two-dimensional finite element modelling is used to re-interpret the pre-1994 eruption deformation data, demonstrating that the observed pattern may have been caused by dykes located in sectors of the ring fault system, as delimited by seismicity. Both a pressurised ring structure and a pair of arcuate sources are modelled. Maximum compressional stress results in a central position within the encompassed block, and a moat-like feature forms offset outwards from the intersection of the azimuth of the modelled deformation sources and the free surface. The modelled deformation generally fits well with the observed movements. That the shallow ring dyke appears not to be complete, existing as two discrete arcuate dykes, helps to explain observed changes in the indicated tilt directions through time. Changing areas of relative down-warping offset outwards from the seismically active ring structure, and north/south-oriented structural up-doming south of Matupit. The distribution of thermal anomalies, and the lack of evidence for shallow central caldera intrusions, can also be explained by this scenario. Associated normal faulting above these dykes, and/or the stress regime generated by simultaneous intrusions into opposite sides of the ring fault, are proposed to explain the apparent inward dip of the intrusions at very shallow levels, leading to the eruptive sites being offset outwards from the seismic zone. A conceptual model is proposed to try to explain the general behaviour of the caldera between 1971 and the eruption of 1994.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Saunders","given":"Steve J."}],"citation-key":"Saunders_2001_ShallowPlumbing","container-title":"Bulletin of Volcanology","container-title-short":"Bull Volcanol","DOI":"10.1007/s004450100159","ISSN":"0258-8900, 1432-0819","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"406-420","source":"link.springer.com","title":"The shallow plumbing system of Rabaul caldera: a partially intruded ring fault?","title-short":"The shallow plumbing system of Rabaul caldera","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004450100159","volume":"63"},
  {"id":"Savage_1983_DislocationModel","abstract":"Strain accumulation and release at a subduction zone are attributed to stick slip on the main thrust zone and steady aseismic slip on the remainder of the plate interface. This process can be described as a superposition of steady state subduction and a repetitive cycle of slip on the main thrust zone, consisting of steady normal slip at the plate convergence rate plus occasional thrust events that recover the accumulated normal slip. Because steady state subduction does not contribute to the deformation at the free surface, deformation observed there is completely equivalent to that produced by the slip cycle alone. The response to that slip is simply the response of a particular earth model to embedded dislocations. For a purely elastic earth model, the deformation cycle consists of a coseismic offset followed by a linear-in-time recovery to the initial value during the interval between earthquakes. For an elastic-viscoelastic earth model (elastic lithosphere over a viscoelastic asthenosphere), the postearthquake recovery is not linear in time. Records of local uplift as a function of time indicate that the long-term postseismic recovery is approximately linear, suggesting that elastic earth models are adequate to describe the deformation cycle. However, the deformation predicted for a simple elastic half-space earth model does not reproduce the deformation observed along the subduction zones in Japan at all well if stick slip is restricted to the main thrust zone. As recognized earlier by Shimazaki, Seno, and Kato, the uplift profiles could be explained if stick slip were postulated to extend along the plate interface beyond the main thrust zone to a depth of perhaps 100 km, but independent evidence suggests that stick slip at such depths is unlikely.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Savage","given":"J.

In inverting the surface deformation data to obtain the slip distribution, the Earth is generally approximated by an elastic half-space. Slip distributions inferred from a half-space model may contain artifacts, including zones of reversed slip, due solely to effects of layering in the real Earth. This effect is demonstrated for a vertical strike-slip fault in an Earth consisting of an elastic layer overlying an elastic half-space. Slip on the fault is taken to be independent of the along-strike coordinate (i.e., antiplane strain is assumed). For a given slip distribution in this model the slip distribution on a similar fault in an elastic half-space is found that produces the identical surface deformation. Comparison of the two slip distributions reveals structure introduced into the half-space equivalent slip profile by crustal layering. The comparisons suggest that low-resolution inversion schemes (e.g., single screw dislocation models) are not drastically affected by Earth structure, but attempts at detailed inversion are likely to produce profiles contaminated by artifacts of Earth structure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Savage","given":"J.

The deformation at the free surface is calculated for an earthquake cycle imposed by prescribed slip on a transform fault. This deformation is compared to that produced by a similar cycle in an elastic half space so that the effects of viscoelastic relaxation in the asthenosphere may be isolated. The following conclusions are drawn: (1) The surface deformation produced by viscoelastic relaxation in the asthenosphere can be duplicated identically by a reasonable distribution of slip at depth on a vertical fault in an elastic half space. Thus differentiation of two possible modes of postearthquake readjustment will be difficult. (2) The effect of asthenosphere relaxation is important only if the depth of the seismic zone is comparable to the thickness of the lithosphere. If the seismic zone is 15 km deep and the lithosphere is 75 km thick, as commonly estimated for the San Andreas fault zone, asthenosphere relaxation is not particularly significant in determining surface deformation. (3) In a periodic sequence of earthquakes the principal observable effects of viscoelasticity in the asthenosphere are to produce a rapid postearthquake deformation and to concentrate strain accumulation and relaxation even closer to the fault than in the elastic half-space model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Savage","given":"J.

The proposed technique is based on the spectral properties of the complex SAR signal. Unlike conventional coregistration methods, the proposed technique does not need any interpolation nor cross-correlation procedures and also no coherence or fringe optimization must be performed. Instead, the phase information of different spectral looks is evaluated giving misregistration information on a pixel by pixel basis. The proposed technique is at least as accurate as the conventional algorithms and its implementation is very simple. Airborne repeat-pass interferometric data and simulated ScanSAR data are used to illustrate the operation of the proposed technique.","author":[{"family":"Scheiber","given":"Rolf"},{"family":"Moreira","given":"Alberto"}],"citation-key":"Scheiber.Moreira_2000_CoregistrationInterferometric","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","DOI":"10.1109/36.868876","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",9,1]]},"note":"ZSCC:00409\nMAG ID: 2116577232\nS2ID: 0adb0304e809dc80af243bde75cad1392dc5ce11","page":"2179-2191","title":"Coregistration of interferometric SAR images using spectral diversity","type":"article-journal","volume":"38"},

  {"id":"Schwartz_2018_ReviewFuture","abstract":"The potential rupture length of an active fault is primary input, and an uncertainty, in source characterization for seismic hazard analysis. The past several decades have seen source models in which faults are divided into potential rupture segments based on fault‐specific behavioral and geometric observations. These models (prescribed segmentation) produced single and multisegment ruptures for use in earthquake probability and regional ground‐motion estimates. The 2013 Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast, Version 3 (UCERF3), relaxed segmentation through modeling of fault‐to‐fault jumps that result in ruptures along the San Andreas fault system as long as 1200 km. Principle controls of UCERF3 rupture length are the stepover distance between different faults or fault sections, and their orientation relative to modeled coulomb stress changes. Observations of surface faulting worldwide since the mid‐1800s in shallow continental crust show that only 30 of the reported ruptures, about 12% of the reported examples, have been longer than 100 km; only 6 have been longer than 300 km and none has exceeded 500 km. A review of characteristics of long ruptures shows that, in general, they occur along essentially continuous traces with limited stepping or branching from one fault to another as opposed to rupture propagation on linkages of different faults with highly variable physical characteristics. These commonly occupy from 10% to 70% of the total host fault length. Neither segmented nor relaxed models of rupture length have been tested by the occurrence of actual ruptures. There is no reason why segmentation models incorporating timing, dynamic, and rheological factors cannot provide reasonable approximations of future rupture length. For many faults of concern worldwide, this may be the most effective approach.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Schwartz","given":"David P."}],"citation-key":"Schwartz_2018_ReviewFuture","container-title":"Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America","container-title-short":"Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America","DOI":"10.1785/0120160110","ISSN":"0037-1106","issue":"5A","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,24]]},"page":"2493-2520","source":"Silverchair","title":"Review: Past and Future Fault Rupture Lengths in Seismic Source Characterization—The Long and Short of It","title-short":"Review","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1785/0120160110","volume":"108"},

We describe results from a 1.5 year-long InSAR time series spanning the March, 2015 extreme precipitation event in the hyperarid Atacama desert of Chile, constraining the immediate increase in soil moisture and drying out over the following months, as well as the response to a later, smaller precipitation event. The inferred temporal evolution of soil moisture is remarkably consistent between independent, overlapping SAR tracks covering a region ~100 km in extent. The unusually large rain event, combined with the extensive spatial and temporal coverage of the SAR dataset, present an unprecedented opportunity to image the time-evolution of soil characteristics over different surface types. Constraints on the timescale of shallow water storage after precipitation events are increasingly valuable as global water resources continue to be stretched to their limits and communities continue to develop in flood-prone areas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Scott","given":"C.

Paul Segall provides the physical and mathematical fundamentals for the models used to interpret deformation measurements near active faults and volcanic centers.\nSegall highlights analytical methods of continuum mechanics applied to problems of active crustal deformation. Topics include elastic dislocation theory in homogeneous and layered half-spaces, crack models of faults and planar intrusions, elastic fields due to pressurized spherical and ellipsoidal magma chambers, time-dependent deformation resulting from faulting in an elastic layer overlying a viscoelastic half-space and related earthquake cycle models, poroelastic effects due to faulting and magma chamber inflation in a fluid-saturated crust, and the effects of gravity on deformation. He also explains changes in the gravitational field due to faulting and magmatic intrusion, effects of irregular surface topography and earth curvature, and modern concepts in rate- and state-dependent fault friction. This textbook presents sample calculations and compares model predictions against field data from seismic and volcanic settings from around the world.\n <i>Earthquake and Volcano Deformation</i> requires working knowledge of stress and strain, and advanced calculus.

We estimate and remove common mode errors in position time series using a principal component analysis, obtaining a significant gain in the signal-to-noise ratio of the displacements data. Following the results of a maximum likelihood estimation analysis, which gives a mean spectral index −0.7, we adopt a power law + white noise stochastic model in estimating the final vertical rates and find 95% of the velocities within ±2 mm/yr, with uncertainties from filtered time series 40% smaller than from the unfiltered ones. We highlight the presence of statistically significant velocity gradients where the stations density is higher. We find undulations of the vertical velocity field at different spatial scales both in tectonically active regions, like eastern Alps, Apennines, and eastern Mediterranean, and in regions characterized by a low or negligible tectonic activity, like central Iberia and western Alps. A correlation between smooth vertical velocities and topographic features is apparent in many sectors of the study area. Glacial isostatic adjustment and weathering processes do not completely explain the measured rates, and a combination of active tectonics and deep-seated geodynamic processes must be invoked. Excluding areas where localized processes are likely, or where subduction processes may be active, mantle dynamics is the most likely process, but regional mantle modeling is required for a better understanding.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Serpelloni","given":"Enrico"},{"family":"Faccenna","given":"Claudio"},{"family":"Spada","given":"Giorgio"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Danan"},{"family":"Williams","given":"Simon D.

  {"id":"Shelly_2017_15Year","abstract":"Low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs) are small, rapidly recurring slip events that occur on the deep extensions of some major faults. Their collective activation is often observed as a semicontinuous signal known as tectonic (or nonvolcanic) tremor. This manuscript presents a catalog of more than 1 million LFEs detected along the central San Andreas Fault from 2001 to 2016. These events have been detected via a multichannel matched-ﬁlter search, cross-correlating waveform templates representing 88 different LFE families with continuous seismic data. Together, these source locations span nearly 150 km along the central San Andreas Fault, ranging in depth from ~16 to 30 km. This accumulating catalog has been the source for numerous studies examining the behavior of these LFE sources and the inferred slip behavior of the deep fault. The relatively high temporal and spatial resolutions of the catalog have provided new insights into properties such as tremor migration, recurrence, and triggering by static and dynamic stress perturbations. Collectively, these characteristics are inferred to reﬂect a very weak fault likely under near-lithostatic ﬂuid pressure, yet the physical processes controlling the stuttering rupture observed as tremor and LFE signals remain poorly understood. This paper aims to document the LFE catalog assembly process and associated caveats, while also updating earlier observations and inferred physical constraints. The catalog itself accompanies this manuscript as part of the electronic supplement, with the goal of providing a useful resource for continued future investigations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Shelly","given":"David R."}],"citation-key":"Shelly_2017_15Year","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"Shelly.etal_2016_FluidfaultingEvolution","abstract":"An extended earthquake swarm occurred beneath southeastern Long Valley Caldera between May and November 2014, culminating in three magnitude 3.5 earthquakes and 1145 cataloged events on 26 September alone. The swarm produced the most proliﬁc seismicity in the caldera since a major unrest episode in 1997–1998. To gain insight into the physics controlling swarm evolution, we used large-scale cross correlation between waveforms of cataloged earthquakes and continuous data, producing precise locations for 8494 events, more than 2.5 times the routine catalog. We also estimated magnitudes for 18,634 events (~5.5 times the routine catalog), using a principal component ﬁt to measure waveform amplitudes relative to cataloged events. This expanded and relocated catalog reveals multiple episodes of pronounced hypocenter expansion and migration on a collection of neighboring faults. Given the rapid migration and alignment of hypocenters on narrow faults, we infer that activity was initiated and sustained by an evolving ﬂuid pressure transient with a low-viscosity ﬂuid, likely composed primarily of water and CO2 exsolved from underlying magma. Although both updip and downdip migration were observed within the swarm, downdip activity ceased shortly after activation, while updip activity persisted for weeks at moderate levels. Strongly migrating, single-fault episodes within the larger swarm exhibited a higher proportion of larger earthquakes (lower Gutenberg-Richter b value), which may have been facilitated by ﬂuid pressure conﬁned in two dimensions within the fault zone. In contrast, the later swarm activity occurred on an increasingly diffuse collection of smaller faults, with a much higher b value.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Shelly","given":"David R."},{"family":"Ellsworth","given":"William L."},{"family":"Hill","given":"David P."}],"citation-key":"Shelly.etal_2016_FluidfaultingEvolution","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","container-title-short":"J.

This is particularly the case when deformation and topography are correlated. To address limitations of previous InSAR tropospheric correction methods, here we present a new approach that combines the use of both external weather model data and the interferometric phase. We assume that vertical refractivity profiles calculated from a high-resolution weather model data can generally describe the form of the relationship between tropospheric delay and height but that the magnitude can be incorrect. We estimate a magnitude correction by scaling the original delays to best match the interferometric phase.

  {"id":"Shibazaki.Shimamoto_2007_ModellingShortinterval","abstract":"Recent high-resolution observations of crustal movements have revealed silent slip events (SSEs) with propagation velocities of around 10–15 km d−1 and with intervals of 3–14 months along the deeper parts of the Cascadia and Nankai subduction zones. This study develops 2-D and 3-D models of these short-interval SSEs considering the frictional behaviour that was conﬁrmed experimentally by Shimamoto for the unstable–stable transition regime. To represent this frictional behaviour, a small cut-off velocity to an evolution effect is introduced in a rateand state-dependent friction law. When the cut-off velocity to the evolution effect is signiﬁcantly smaller than that to a direct effect, steady-state friction exhibits velocity weakening at low slip velocities and velocity strengthening at high slip velocities. At the deeper Cascadia and Nankai subduction interfaces, the pore pressure is inferred to be high because of the dehydration of materials in the descending plate. Under conditions where the pore-ﬂuid pressure is nearly equal to the lithostatic pressure and the critical weakening displacement is very small, shortinterval SSEs with propagation velocities and slip velocities of 4–8 km d−1 and 2 − 4 × 10−7 m s−1, respectively, can be reproduced. The propagation velocity of short-interval SSEs is in proportion to the slip velocity. The results also show that during the nucleation process of large earthquakes, the occurrence of short-interval SSEs becomes irregular because of the accelerated slips that occur at the bottom of the seismogenic zone. Our results suggest that monitoring of short-interval SSEs might be useful for forecasting the main earthquakes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Shibazaki","given":"Bunichiro"},{"family":"Shimamoto","given":"Toshihiko"}],"citation-key":"Shibazaki.Shimamoto_2007_ModellingShortinterval","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2007.03434.x","ISSN":"0956540X, 1365246X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",10]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC:00150","page":"191-205","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Modelling of short-interval silent slip events in deeper subduction interfaces considering the frictional properties at the unstable-stable transition regime","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/gji/article-lookup/doi/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2007.03434.x","volume":"171"},

Geological investigations have elucidated the relatively simple evolution of this channel and related landforms and deposits. This history requires that the average rate of slip along the San Andreas fault has been 33.9 ± 2.9 mm/yr for the past 3,700 yr and 35.8 + 5.4/-4.1 mm/yr for the past 13,250 yr. Small gullies near Wallace Creek record evidence for the amount of dextral slip during the past three great earthquakes. Slip during these great earthquakes ranged from ~9.5 to 12.3 m. Using these values and the average rate of slip during the late Holocene, we estimate that the period of dormancy preceding each of the past 3 great earthquakes was between 240 and 450 yr. This is in marked contrast to the shorter intervals ( - 1 5 0 yr) documented at sites 100 to 300 km to the southeast. These lengthy intervals suggest that a major portion of the San Andreas fault represented by the Wallace Creek site will not generate a great earthquake for at least another 100 yr. The slip rate determined at Wallace Creek enables us to argue, however, that rupture of a 90-km-long segment northwest of Wallace Creek, which sustained as much as 3.5 m of slip in 1857, is likely to generate a major earthquake by the turn of the century.","author":[{"family":"Sieh","given":"Kerry E"},{"family":"Jahns","given":"Richard H"}],"citation-key":"Sieh.Jahns_HoloceneActivity","language":"en","page":"14","source":"Zotero","title":"Holocene activity of the San Andreas fault at Wallace Creek, California","type":"article-journal"},

Here we propose a new modelling framework that resolves this discrepancy by accounting for magma buoyancy, viscoelastic crustal properties, and sustained magma channels. At low magma accumulation rates, the stability of deep magma bodies is governed by the magma-host rock density contrast and the magma body thickness. During eruptions, inelastic processes including magma mush erosion and thermal effects, can form a sustained channel that supports magma flow, driven by the pressure difference between the magma body and surface vents.

  {"id":"Simons_2002_CoseismicDeformation","abstract":"We use interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and Global Positioning System (GPS) observations to investigate static deformation due to the 1999 Mw 7.1 Hector Mine earthquake, that occurred in the eastern California shear zone. Interferometric decorrelation, phase, and azimuth offset measurements indicate regions of surface and near-surface slip, which we use to constrain the geometry of surface rupture. The inferred geometry is spatially complex, with multiple strands. The southern third of the rupture zone consists of three subparallel segments extending about 20 km in length in a N45ЊW direction. The central segment is the simplest, with a single strand crossing the Bullion Mountains and a strike of N10ЊW. The northern third of the rupture zone is characterized by multiple splays, with directions subparallel to strikes in the southern and central. The average strike for the entire rupture is about N30ЊW. The interferograms indicate signiﬁcant alongstrike variations in strain which are consistent with variations in the ground-based slip measurements. Using a variable resolution data sampling routine to reduce the computational burden, we invert the InSAR and GPS data for the fault geometry and distribution of slip. We compare results from assuming an elastic half-space and a layered elastic space. Results from these two elastic models are similar, although the layered-space model predicts more slip at depth than does the half-space model. The layered model predicts a maximum coseismic slip of more than 5 m at a depth of 3 to 6 km. Contrary to preliminary reports, the northern part of the Hector Mine rupture accommodates the maximum slip. Our model predictions for the surface fault offset and total seismic moment agree with both ﬁeld mapping results and recent seismic models. The inferred shallow slip deﬁcit is enigmatic and may suggest that distributed inelastic yielding occurred in the uppermost few kilometers of the crust during or soon after the earthquake.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Simons","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"Simons_2002_CoseismicDeformation","container-title":"Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America","container-title-short":"Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America","DOI":"10.1785/0120000933","ISSN":"0037-1106","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1390-1402","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Coseismic Deformation from the 1999 Mw 7.1 Hector Mine, California, Earthquake as Inferred from InSAR and GPS Observations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/bssa/article/92/4/1390-1402/120788","volume":"92"},

Here, we propose EikoNet, a deep learning approach to solving the Eikonal equation, which characterizes the ﬁrst-arrivaltime ﬁeld in heterogeneous 3D velocity structures. Our grid-free approach allows for rapid determination of the travel time between any two points within a continuous 3D domain. These travel time solutions are allowed to violate the diﬀerential equation—which casts the problem as one of optimization—with the goal of ﬁnding network parameters that minimize the degree to which the equation is violated. In doing so, the method exploits the diﬀerentiability of neural networks to calculate the spatial gradients analytically, meaning the network can be trained on its own without ever needing solutions from a ﬁnite diﬀerence algorithm. EikoNet is rigorously tested on several velocity models and sampling methods to demonstrate robustness and versatility. Training and inference are highly parallelized, making the approach well-suited for GPUs. EikoNet has low memory overhead, and further avoids the need for travel-time lookup tables.

A specific feature of that case example is the exponential rise of seismicity that was detected nearly 30 years after the onset of production. In this study, the subsurface is represented as a homogeneous isotropic linear poroelastic half-space subject to stress changes in three-dimensional space due to reservoir compaction and pore pressure variations. The reservoir is represented with cuboidal strain volumes. Stress changes within and outside the reservoir are calculated using a simple convolution with semi-analytical Green functions. The uniaxial compressibility of the reservoir is spatially variable and constrained with surface subsidence data. Coulomb stress changes are maximum near the top and bottom of the reservoir where the reservoir is offset by faults. To assess earthquake probability, we use the standard Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion assuming instantaneous nucleation and a non-critical initial stress. The distribution of initial strength excess, the difference between the initial Coulomb stress and the critical Coulomb stress at failure, is treated as a stochastic variable and estimated from the observations. We calculate stress changes since the onset of gas production. The lag and exponential onset of seismicity are well reproduced assuming either a a generalized Pareto distribution of initial strength excess, which can represent the tail of any distribution, or a Gaussian distribution, to describe both the tail and body of the distribution. This representation allows to test if the induced seismicity at Groningen has transitioned to the steady-state where seismicity rate is proportional to the stressing rate. Our results indicate that the system has not yet reached such a steady-state regime. The forecast is robust to uncertainties about the ability of the model to represent accurately the physical processes. It does require in particular a priori knowledge of the faults that can be activated. The method presented here is in principle applicable to induced seismicity in any setting provided deformation and seismicity data are available to calibrate the model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Jonathan Daniel"},{"family":"Heimisson","given":"Elias Rafn"},{"family":"Bourne","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Avouac","given":"Jean-Philippe"}],"citation-key":"Smith.etal_2021_StressbasedForecasting","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,15]]},"language":"en","license":"CC BY Attribution 4.0 International","publisher":"EarthArXiv","source":"eartharxiv.org","title":"Stress-based forecasting of induced seismicity with instantaneous earthquake failure functions: Applications to the Groningen Gas Reservoir.","title-short":"Stress-based forecasting of induced seismicity with instantaneous earthquake failure functions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/2692/"},

We show that in the initially cold lithosphere expected at the DST, shear deformation localizes in a 20–40 km wide zone where temperature-controlled mantle strength is minimal. The resulting mechanically weak decoupling zone extends sub-vertically through the entire lithosphere. One or two major faults at the top of this zone take up most of the transform displacement. These and other modelling results are consistent with geological observations and lithospheric structures imaged along the DESERT seismic line, suggesting that the Arava Valley segment of the DST is an almost pure strike-slip plate boundary with less than 3 km of transform-perpendicular extension. Modelling suggests that the location of the Arava Valley segment of the DST has been controlled by the minimum in lithospheric strength possibly associated with margin of the Arabian Shield lithosphere and/or by regionally increased crustal thickness. Models also show that heating of the Arabian Shield mantle adjacent to the DST, inferred independently by petrological and seismological studies, is required to explain asymmetric Late Cenozoic uplift in the area.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Sobolev","given":"S.

In particular, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can image the Earth's surface and map damage in all weather conditions, day and night. However, current SAR damage mapping methods struggle to separate damage from other changes in the Earth's surface. In this study, we propose a novel approach to damage mapping, combining deep learning with the full time history of SAR observations of an impacted region in order to detect anomalous variations in the Earth's surface properties due to a natural disaster. We quantify Earth surface change using time series of Interferometric SAR coherence, then use a recurrent neural network (RNN) as a probabilistic anomaly detector on these coherence time series. The RNN is first trained on pre-event coherence time series, and then forecasts a probability distribution of the coherence between pre- and post-event SAR images. The difference between the forecast and observed co-event coherence provides a measure of the confidence in the identification of damage. The method allows the user to choose a damage detection threshold that is customized for each location, based on the local behavior of coherence through time before the event. We apply this method to calculate estimates of damage for three earthquakes using multi-year time series of Sentinel-1 SAR acquisitions. Our approach shows good agreement with observed damage and quantitative improvement compared to using pre- to co-event coherence loss as a damage proxy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Stephenson","given":"Oliver L."},{"family":"Köhne","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Zhan","given":"Eric"},{"family":"Cahill","given":"Brent E."},{"family":"Yun","given":"Sang-Ho"},{"family":"Ross","given":"Zachary E."},{"family":"Simons","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"Stephenson.etal_2021_DeepLearningbased","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","container-title-short":"IEEE Trans.

  {"id":"Stephenson.etal_2021_EvidenceInnermost","abstract":"The model of cylindrical anisotropy in the inner core (IC) states that seismic rays traveling parallel to the Earth's rotational axis travel faster than those parallel to the equator. There have been continuing discrepancies in estimates of the strength and orientation of anisotropy, with some evidence suggesting that such a model may not be supported by available data. Here, we scrutinize the radial dependence of anisotropy within the IC, where the nature of anisotropy has been shown to change anywhere between a 300 and 800 km radius. We use recent travel time data from the International Seismological Centre in conjunction with the neighborhood algorithm to provide a robust means of testing this idea, through examination of an ensemble of models that satisfactorily fit the data. This can be done with no explicit regularization and without the need for subjective choices associated with binning of phase data. In addition, uncertainty bounds are calculated for anisotropic parameters using a likelihood ratio approach. We find evidence to suggest that commonly employed spatial averaging (binning) methods may be detrimental to obtaining reliable results. We conclude that there is no significant change in the strength of anisotropy with depth in the IC. Instead, we find a change in the slow direction of anisotropy to 54° within the innermost IC at an ∼650 km radius with fast direction parallel to the Earth's rotational axis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Stephenson","given":"J."},{"family":"Tkalčić","given":"H"},{"family":"Sambridge","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"Stephenson.etal_2021_EvidenceInnermost","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","container-title-short":"J.

The range-dependent incidence angle of the InSAR observations, coupled with plate velocities of centimeters per year, can induce long-wavelength spatial gradients of millimeters per year over hundreds of kilometers in InSAR velocity fields. We show that, after applying corrections, including for the ionosphere and troposphere, plate motion represents the dominant source of long-wavelength secular velocity gradients in multi-year time series for several study areas.

  {"id":"Stevens.Avouac_2021_RelationshipStrain","abstract":"The increasing density of geodetic measurements makes it possible to map surface strain rate in many zones of active tectonics with unprecedented spatial resolution. Here we show that the strain tensor rate calculated from GPS in the India–Asia collision zone represents well the strain released in earthquakes. This means that geodetic data in the India–Asia collision zone region can be extrapolated back in time to estimate strain buildup on active faults, or the kinematics of continental deformation. We infer that the geodetic strain rates can be assumed stationary through time on the timescale needed to build up the elastic strain released by larger earthquakes, and that they can be used to estimate the probability of triggering earthquakes. We show that the background seismicity rate correlates with the geodetic strain rate. A good ﬁt is obtained assuming a linear relationship (N˙ = λ · ˙, where N˙ is the density of the rate of Mw ≥ 4 earthquakes, ˙ is strain rate and λ = 2.5 ± 0.1 × 10−3 m−2), as would be expected from a standard Coulomb failure model. However, the ﬁt is signiﬁcantly better for a non-linear relationship (N˙ = γ1 · ˙γ2 with γ 1 = 2.5 ± 0.6 m−2 and γ 2 = 1.42 ± 0.15). The b-value of the Gutenberg–Richter law, which characterize the magnitude–frequency distribution, is found to be insensitive to the strain rate. In the case of a linear correlation between seismicity and strain rate, the maximum magnitude earthquake, derived from the moment conservation principle, is expected to be independent of the strain rate. By contrast, the non-linear case implies that the maximum magnitude earthquake would be larger in zones of low strain rate. We show that within areas of constant strain rate, earthquakes above Mw 4 follow a Poisson distribution in time and and are uniformly distributed in space. These ﬁndings provide a framework to estimate the probability of occurrence and magnitude of earthquakes as a function of the geodetic strain rate. We describe how the seismicity models derived from this approach can be used as an input for probabilistic seismic hazard analysis. This method is easy to automatically update, and can be applied in a consistent manner to any continental zone of active tectonics with sufﬁcient geodetic coverage.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Stevens","given":"V L"},{"family":"Avouac","given":"J-P"}],"citation-key":"Stevens.Avouac_2021_RelationshipStrain","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1093/gji/ggab098","ISSN":"0956-540X, 1365-246X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4,12]]},"language":"en","page":"220-245","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"On the relationship between strain rate and seismicity in the India–Asia collision zone: implications for probabilistic seismic hazard","title-short":"On the relationship between strain rate and seismicity in the India–Asia collision zone","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/226/1/220/6168368","volume":"226"},

  {"id":"Sudhaus.Sigurjon_2009_ImprovedSource","abstract":"Simultaneous use of multiple independent data sets can improve constraints on earthquake source-model parameters. However, the ways in which data sets have been combined in the past are manifold and usually qualitative. In this paper we present a method to combine geodetic data in source model estimations, which includes characterizing the data errors and estimating realistic model-parameter uncertainties caused by these errors. We demonstrate this method in a case study of the June 2000 Kleifarvatn earthquake, which occurred on Reykjanes Peninsula in Iceland. We begin by showing to what extent additional data can positively influence the source modelling results, by combining both GPS and descending-orbit InSAR data, which were used in two earlier studies of that event, with InSAR data from an ascending orbit. We estimate the data error covariances of the InSAR observations and base the data weights in our model-parameter optimization on the corresponding data variance–covariance matrix. We also derive multiple sets of synthetic data errors from the estimated data covariances that we use to modify the original data to generate numerous data realizations. From these data realizations we estimate the model-parameter uncertainties. We first model the Kleifarvatn earthquake as a simple uniform-slip fault and subsequently as a fault with variable slip and rake. Our fault model matches well with the field observations of coseismic surface ruptures and its near-vertical dip (83°) agrees with the regional faulting style as well as with aftershock locations. The two published source models of the event, on the other hand, both differ from our model as well as differing for one another. These studies, which were based on the descending InSAR data alone (the first study) and on that same data and GPS data (the second study), both neglect correlations in the InSAR data and do not report model-parameter uncertainties. Therefore, to compare these results with our model, we simulate the earlier model estimation set-ups and provide realistic estimates of the model-parameters uncertainties for these cases. We then discuss the significance of the difference between the existing fault models and demonstrate that both the inclusion of additional independent data as well as the covariance-based data weights improve the model-parameter estimation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Sudhaus","given":"Henriette"},{"family":"Sigurjón","given":"Jónsson"}],"citation-key":"Sudhaus.Sigurjon_2009_ImprovedSource","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","container-title-short":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2008.03989.x","ISSN":"0956-540X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",2,1]]},"page":"389-404","source":"Silverchair","title":"Improved source modelling through combined use of InSAR and GPS under consideration of correlated data errors: application to the June 2000 Kleifarvatn earthquake, Iceland","title-short":"Improved source modelling through combined use of InSAR and GPS under consideration of correlated data errors","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2008.03989.x","volume":"176"},

  {"id":"Taboada.Renouf_2023_RheologyBreakdown","abstract":"We study the initiation and growth of a dry granular shear zone subjected to seismic shearing and flash heating from the perspective of a discrete element method. For this purpose, we created a semi-periodic numerical shear test similar to a rotary shear machine in which a 2 mm ×1.5 mm sample composed of micrometric cohesive disks is sheared in between two rigid walls. The strength of cohesive bonds is defined according to an elasto-brittle contact law calibrated to simulate peak and residual strength envelopes derived from rock mechanics tests. The sample is traversed by a pre-existing fracture and subjected to a vertical confining pressure (e.g. 112.5 MPa) and a velocity step function (e.g. 1 m s–1) applied on the top and bottom walls, respectively. Slip along the fracture induces the growth of a shear zone, which thickens by progressive abrasion of damaged material from cohesive blocks. We carried out two parametric studies to determine the rheology and physical properties of the shear zone for slip velocities and confining pressures characteristic of shallow earthquakes and several flash-heating temperatures. According to parametric studies, the mechanical behavior of the shear zone exhibits three distinct phases. The initial phase of rupture initiation is characterized by the propagation of a shear instability generated by the velocity step (phase 1). During this phase, friction and dilatancy curves are approximated by asymmetric peak functions whose amplitude and geometry are controlled primarily by confining pressure. In the intermediate phase of shear-zone growth, the sample displays an initial transient stage that asymptotically approaches steady state at submelting temperatures (phase 2). According to the inertial number, seismic shearing occurs under quasi-static conditions despite high shear rates. Thus, friction and dilatancy observed in all simulations are roughly constant regardless of slip velocity, confining pressure, and gouge zone thickness. In the final phase of shear weakening, the model evolves toward a new steady state at flash-heating temperatures (phase 3). Average friction and dilatancy are represented by sigmoidal decreasing curves that approach steady-state values lower than for phase 2. Predictably, the thermally weakened friction in steady state (μss ∼ 0.1) is close to the strength of frictionless granular samples sheared in quasi-static conditions. We calculate breakdown energies for the gouge and damage zones and the fracture energy at intermediate and high confining pressures. We show that breakdown energy fundamentally differs from fracture energy commonly used in seismology. The breakdown energy of the damage zones shows long-period damped oscillations weakly correlated with shear-stress fluctuations around average decaying values. Our results suggest that dilatancy is the primary energy sink within the damage zones at steady-state values. The breakdown energy components of the gouge zone follow a similar decaying trend as the average fracture energy but over a longer critical distance. Decohesion and dilatancy are the major energy sinks linked to gouge formation at intermediate pressures. In contrast, dilatancy and debonding frictional energies predominate at high confining pressures. Breakdown energy is equivalent to a fraction of fracture energy that nearly triples when doubling the confining pressure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Taboada","given":"A"},{"family":"Renouf","given":"M"}],"citation-key":"Taboada.Renouf_2023_RheologyBreakdown","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","container-title-short":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1093/gji/ggad004","ISSN":"0956-540X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,1]]},"page":"1492-1514","source":"Silverchair","title":"Rheology and breakdown energy of a shear zone undergoing flash heating in earthquake-like discrete element models","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggad004","volume":"233"},

  {"id":"Templeton.etal_2008_BehaviorRepeating","abstract":"Repeating earthquakes (REs) are sequences of events that have nearly identical waveforms and are interpreted to represent fault asperities driven to failure by loading from aseismic creep on the surrounding fault surface at depth. We investigate the occurrence of these REs along faults in central California to determine which faults exhibit creep and the spatiotemporal distribution of this creep. At the juncture of the San Andreas and southern Calaveras–Paicines faults, both faults as well as a smaller secondary fault, the Quien Sabe fault, are observed to produce REs over the observation period of March 1984 through May 2005. REs in this area reflect a heterogeneous creep distribution along the fault plane with significant variations in time. Cumulative slip over the observation period at individual sequence locations is determined to range from 5.5–58.2 cm on the San Andreas fault, from 4.8–14.1 cm on the southern Calaveras–Paicines fault, and from 4.9–24.8 cm on the Quien Sabe fault. Creep at depth appears to mimic the behaviors seen for creep on the surface in that evidence of steady slip, triggered slip, and episodic slip phenomena are also observed in the RE sequences. For comparison, we investigate the occurrence of REs west of the San Andreas fault within the southern Coast Range. Events within these RE sequences occurred only minutes to weeks apart from each other and then did not repeat again over the observation period, suggesting that REs in this area are not produced by steady aseismic creep of the surrounding fault surface.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Templeton","given":"D.

It provides the French ForM@ter scientific community with automatically processed products using a state of the art processing chain based on a small baseline subset approach, namely the New Small Baseline (NSBAS). The service results from a collaboration between the scientific team that develops and maintains the NSBAS processing chain and the French Spatial Agency (CNES) that mirrors the Sentinel-1 data. The proximity to Sentinel-1 data, the NSBAS workflow, and the specific optimizations to make NSBAS processing massively parallel for the CNES high performance computing infrastructure ensures the efficiency of the chain, especially in terms of input and output, which is the key for the success of such a service. The FLATSIM service is made of a production module, a delivery module and a user access module. Products include interferograms, surface line of sight velocity, phase delay time series and auxiliary data. Numerous quality indicators are provided for an in-depth analysis of the quality and limits of the results. The first national call in 2020 for region of interest ended up with 8 regions spread over the world with scientific interests, including seismology, tectonics, volcano-tectonics, and hydrological cycle.

  {"id":"Titus.etal_2004_ThirtyFiveYearCreep","abstract":"We present results from differential Global Positioning System (GPS) surveys of seven alignment arrays and four continuous GPS sites along the creeping segment of the San Andreas fault. Surveys of four alignment arrays from the central creeping segment yield 33- to 36-year average minimum slip rates of 21–26 mm/yr. These rates are consistent with previous alignment array surveys spanning a 10-year period and with rates determined by creepmeters, indicating approximate steadystate creep along the central creeping segment for at least 35 years. Motion between continuous GPS sites that span the central creeping segment is 28.2 ע 0.5 mm/yr for two sites that are 1 km apart and 33.6 ע 1 mm/yr for two sites that are 70 km apart. Slip rates therefore increase with distance from the creeping segment of the San Andreas fault. All rates reported here are signiﬁcantly slower than the 39 ע 2 mm/yr rate predicted for motion between the Sierra Nevada–Great Valley block and the Paciﬁc plate. Repeat surveys of three alignment arrays following the 2004 Parkﬁeld earthquake demonstrate that its coseismic and short-term postseismic offsets decrease rapidly with distance from the epicenter, from 150 mm to 15 mm to Ͻ5 mm at respective distances of 9, 36, and 54 km to the northwest. Continuous GPS data conﬁrm that little coseismic and postseismic slip occurred along the central creeping segment.

The standard deviations of the predicted secular velocity from the four models are larger north of the San Francisco Bay area, near the creeping segment in Central California, and along the San Jacinto Fault and the East California Shear Zone in Southern California. A coherence spectrum analysis of the secular velocity fields indicates relatively high correlation among the four models at longer wavelengths (>15–40 km), with lower correlation at shorter wavelengths. To improve the short-wavelength accuracy of the interseismic velocity model, we integrated interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations, initially from Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) ascending data (spanning from the middle of 2006 to the end of 2010, totaling more than 1100 interferograms), with GPS observations using a Sum/Remove/Filter/Restore approach. The final InSAR line of sight data match the point GPS observations with a mean absolute deviation of 1.5 mm/yr. We systematically evaluated the fault creep rates along major faults of the San Andreas Fault and compared them with creepmeters and alignment array data compiled in Uniform California Earthquake Rupture Forecast, Version 2 (UCERF2). Moreover, this InSAR line of sight dataset can constrain rapid velocity gradients near the faults, which are critical for understanding the along-strike variations in stress accumulation rate and associated earthquake hazard.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Tong","given":"X."},{"family":"Sandwell","given":"D.

  {"id":"Trasatti.etal_2005_StructuralRheological","abstract":"The 1982–1984 unrest episode at Campi Flegrei (CF) caldera, Italy, was characterized by huge deformation (more than 1.5 m uplift) concentrated inside the caldera. According to point source isotropic models in homogeneous elastic and visco-elastic half-spaces, the source depth is very shallow (~3 km). If the source radius is ~1 km, this implies that magma is at a depth of ~2 km depth. However, several independent observations show that the top of the magma chamber at CF must be deeper than ~4 km. This paper investigates how the inferred source depth increases when rigidity heterogeneities (obtained through seismic tomography at CF) are considered and when the long-term deformation takes place under drained conditions. Finite element models indicate that overpressure needed at the source to reproduce the 1.5 m maximum uplift is however beyond typical rock strength values. This evidence, together with the high thermal anomalies, the presence of fluids and the low cohesion of tuffs filling the caldera, suggests the use of elasto-plastic constitutive laws. For elasto-plastic behavior, the same deformation is obtained using a deeper source (with center at ~5 km depth) and a lower overpressure (than required by elastic models). The plastic deformation concentrates both at the source boundaries and above the source, where seismic activity has been recorded. These results indicate that the rheological properties of the shallow crust of CF have important implications for hazard estimate during unrest episodes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Trasatti","given":"E."},{"family":"Giunchi","given":"C."},{"family":"Bonafede","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"Trasatti.etal_2005_StructuralRheological","container-title":"Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research","container-title-short":"Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research","DOI":"10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2004.11.019","ISSN":"03770273","issue":"1-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",6]]},"language":"en","page":"105-118","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Structural and rheological constraints on source depth and overpressure estimates at the Campi Flegrei caldera, Italy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0377027304004202","volume":"144"},
  {"id":"Trasatti.etal_EctsTopography","abstract":"The ground deformation produced by a spherical overpressure source in a heterogeneous elastic and/or viscoelastic medium is investigated by numerical models based on the finite element method. Sources are assumed to be located at different depths beneath Mount Etna, Sicily, Italy, the structure of which is approximated as axially symmetric. Finite element modelling allows to incorporate in the analysis realistic features such as topographic relief and the laterally heterogeneous multi-layered structure inferred from seismic tomography. In order to avoid introducing artifacts in the solution, great care was taken to calibrate the computational domain necessary to reproduce analytical results accurately. An elastic analysis, performed initially, shows significant changes of the deformation field with respect to homogeneous half-space solutions: topography induces slight but detectable changes in the deformation field; in particular the maximum value of the vertical component is shifted away from the symmetry axis. When introducing the elastic heterogeneities, the ground deformation is found to be more confined to the proximity of the axis and its amplitude is mostly sensitive to the presence of low rigidity layers above the source. The ratio of maximum radial to vertical deformation is significantly larger for deeper sources. A further development of the model includes the study of inelastic properties assuming a Maxwell viscoelastic rheology for different layers. If the viscoelastic rheology is applied only to layers deeper than the source, the solutions are affected in different ways according to the distance of the source from the viscoelastic layer. If a viscoelastic layer is present above the source, a very large amplification (by more than 100%) of the surface deformation is predicted by the model; moreover, uplift transients are found to be followed by subsidence, without invoking any decrease in source overpressure. The most striking effects are observed when the source is embedded within a viscoelastic layer: in this case a static equilibrium configuration is not attained and, in the long term, both components of deformation reverse their signs in proximity to the axis. Furthermore, the surface deformation becomes nearly independent of source depth, in the long term. Simple physical explanations are proposed for the different cases.","author":[{"family":"Trasatti","given":"E"},{"family":"Giunchi","given":"C"},{"family":"Bonafede","given":"M"}],"citation-key":"Trasatti.etal_EctsTopography","container-title":"Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research","language":"en","page":"22","source":"Zotero","title":"E¡ects of topography and rheological layering on ground deformation in volcanic regions","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"Trippanera.etal_2019_StructuralMapping","abstract":"Dike intrusions produce faulting at the surface along with seismic swarms and possible eruptions. Understanding the geometry and kinematics of dike-induced fractures can provide relevant information on what controls magma emplacement and the associated hazards. Here, we focus on the Harrat Lunayyir volcanic ﬁeld (western Saudi Arabia), where in 2009 a dike intrusion formed a NNW-SSE oriented, ten-kilometer-long and up to one-meter deep graben. This widens from ∼2 km in the SSE to ∼5 km in the NNW, showing a well-deﬁned border normal fault to the west but a diffused fracture zone to the east. We conducted a ﬁxed-wing drone survey to create high resolution (∼3.4 cm) ortho-rectiﬁed images and DEMs of the western fault and of a portion of the eastern fracture zone to determine the fracture geometry and kinematics. We then integrated these results with ﬁeld observations and InSAR data from the 2009 intrusion. Both fault zones contain smaller segments (hundreds of meters long) consisting of normal faults and extension fractures, showing two dominant orientation patterns: NNW-SSE (N330◦ ± 10◦) and NW-SE (N300◦ ± 10◦). The NNW-ESE oriented segments are subparallel to the inferred 2009 dike strike (N340◦), to pre-historical Harrat Lunayyir eruptive ﬁssures (N330◦) and to the overall Red Sea axis (N330◦). This suggests that these segments reﬂect the present-day off-rift stress ﬁeld close to the Red Sea shoulder. However, the NW-SE oriented segments are oblique to this pattern and exhibit en–echelon structures, suggesting different processes such as: (1) a transfer (or soft-linkage) between dike-parallel fault segments, (2) a topographic control on the fault propagation and (3) a possible reactivation of inherited regional faults. Vertical fault offsets obtained by the drone survey along the western fault vary with the local lithology and these data are not consistent everywhere with the offsets derived from the 2009 InSAR measurements. Field evidence within lava ﬂows also shows the occurrence of previous slipping event(s) on the fault before the 2009 intrusion. Collectively, we suggest that the mismatch between the drone and InSAR datasets is related to the different spatial and temporal resolutions offered by the two techniques.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Trippanera","given":"Daniele"},{"family":"Ruch","given":"Joël"},{"family":"Passone","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Jónsson","given":"Sigurjón"}],"citation-key":"Trippanera.etal_2019_StructuralMapping","container-title":"Frontiers in Earth Science","container-title-short":"Front.

  {"id":"Trugman.Shearer_2017_GrowClustHierarchical","abstract":"Accurate earthquake locations are essential for providing reliable hazard assessments, understanding the physical mechanisms driving extended earthquake sequences, and interpreting fault structure. Techniques based on waveform cross correlation can significantly improve the precision of the relative locations of event pairs observed at a set of common stations. Here we describe GrowClust, an open-source, relative relocation algorithm that can provide robust relocation results for earthquake sequences over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. The method uses input differential travel times, cross-correlation values, and reference starting locations, and applies a hybrid, hierarchical clustering algorithm to simultaneously group and relocate events within similar event clusters. The method is computationally efficient and numerically stable in its capacity to process large data sets and naturally applies greater weight to more similar event pairs.

Here we report on observations of this “pulsing” slip obtained from advanced multitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data, conﬁrmed using continuous GPS sites of the Plate Boundary Observatory. The surface deformation time series show a strong correlation to the previously documented slip rate variations derived from repeating earthquakes on the fault interface, at various spatial and temporal scales. Time series and spectral analyses of repeating earthquake and InSAR data reveal a quasiperiodic pulsing with a roughly 2 year period along some sections of the fault, with the earthquakes on the fault interface lagging behind the far-ﬁeld deformation by about 6 months. This suggests a temporal delay between the pulsing crustal strain generated by deep-seated shear and the time-variable slip on the shallow fault interface, and that at least in some places this process may be cyclical. There exist potential impacts for time-dependent seismic hazard forecasting in California and, as it becomes better validated in the richly instrumented natural laboratory of the central San Andreas Fault, the process used here will be even more helpful in characterizing hazard and fault zone rheology in areas without California’s geodetic infrastructure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Turner","given":"Ryan C."},{"family":"Shirzaei","given":"Manoochehr"},{"family":"Nadeau","given":"Robert M."},{"family":"Bürgmann","given":"Roland"}],"citation-key":"Turner.etal_2015_SlowGo","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"Uchida_2019_DetectionRepeating","abstract":"Repeating earthquakes (repeaters) that rupture the same fault area (patch) are interpreted to be caused by repeated accumulation and release of stress on the seismic patch in a creeping area. This relationship between repeaters with fault creep can be exploited for tracking the fault creep (slow slip) based on the repeaters’ activity. In other words, the repeaters can be used as creepmeters embedded on a fault. To do this, it is fundamentally important to select earthquakes that definitely re-rupture in the same area. The selections are usually done based on waveform similarity or hypocenter location. In hypocenter-location based detection, the precision of the relative location compared with the dimension of earthquake sources is critical for confirming the co-location of the source area. On the other hand, waveform-similarity-based detection needs to use appropriate parameters including high enough frequency components to distinguish neighboring sources. Inter-event timing (recurrence interval) and/or the duration of a sequence’s activity are good diagnostic features for finding appropriate detection parameters and eliminating non-repeating events, which are important because an inappropriate selection leads to including triggered sequences that do not re-rupture the same area. Repeaters provide an independent estimation of creep from geodetic data and such estimations are mostly in good agreement when both kinds of data are available. Repeater data are especially useful in the deeper part of strike-slip faults and in near-trench areas of subduction zones where geodetic data’s resolution is usually limited. The repeaters also have an advantage with geodetic data analysis because they are not contaminated by viscoelastic deformation or poroelastic rebound which are prominent postseismic process for large earthquakes and occur outside of faults. On the other hand, the disadvantages of repeater analysis include their uneven spatial distribution and the uncertainty of the estimates of slip amount requiring a scaling relationship between earthquake size and slip. There are considerable variations in the inferred slip amounts from different relationships. Applications of repeater analysis illuminate the spatial distribution of interplate stable slip, after slip, and spontaneous and cyclic slow slip events that represent important components of interplate slip processes in addition to major earthquakes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Uchida","given":"Naoki"}],"citation-key":"Uchida_2019_DetectionRepeating","container-title":"Progress in Earth and Planetary Science","container-title-short":"Prog Earth Planet Sci","DOI":"10.1186/s40645-019-0284-z","ISSN":"2197-4284","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12]]},"language":"en","page":"40","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Detection of repeating earthquakes and their application in characterizing slow fault slip","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://progearthplanetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40645-019-0284-z","volume":"6"},

This border also corresponds to the southern limit of the source areas of MN7 interplate earthquakes in the last 80 years along the Japan trench, again indicating the stronger coupling to the north. We also investigate hypocenter distribution and seismic velocity structure along the plate boundary from a large number of travel-time data obtained from the nationwide seismograph network. The results reveal a distinct lowvelocity zone just above the Paciﬁc plate and low seismicity along the plate boundary in the region overlain by the Philippine Sea plate, whereas there are no low-velocity zones and the seismicity is high in the region overlain by the North American plate.

The repeaters (M2.5–6.1) show postseismic magnitude increases for most sequences located in the area of large postseismic slip at the downdip extension of the M9 source region. The magnitudes of the ﬁrst events after the M9 earthquake increased by an average of about 0.3 for sequences having three or more earthquakes over the 9 months following it. We also examined the slip area in detail for Kamaishi repeaters whose magnitudes had been M4.9 ± 0.2 but which increased by about 1 after the M9 earthquake. Waveform modeling shows that the slip area for the post-M9 Kamaishi earthquakes overlaps with that before the Tohoku-oki earthquake but enlarged by about 6 times. Until the occurrence time of the last event (September 2011) in the analysis period, the rupture area remained larger than before but appeared to shrink over time. The enlargement of the rupture area suggests that an aseismic-to-seismic transition occurred in the region surrounding the pre-M9 repeaters and is most likely related to fast loading of the repeaters due to rapid postseismic slip estimated to have occurred in the area. The existence of conditionally stable regions around the repeating earthquakes and/or patches slightly larger than the earthquake nucleation sizes may explain such behavior. The temporal change of loading rate is an important factor in determining earthquake size in this case.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Uchida","given":"Naoki"},{"family":"Shimamura","given":"Kouhei"},{"family":"Matsuzawa","given":"Toru"},{"family":"Okada","given":"Tomomi"}],"citation-key":"Uchida.etal_2015_PostseismicResponse","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","container-title-short":"J.

We estimate cumulative offsets of small repeating earthquakes that are interpreted to reﬂect the in situ aseismic slip history on the subduction zone offshore northeastern Japan. These data reveal contrasting aseismic slip patterns between the coseismic rupture area of the Mw 9.0 Tohoku-oki earthquake and surrounding portions of the subduction thrust. The rupture area is characterised by low and variable slip rates before 2008, and the slip stopped almost completely after the earthquake. The region surrounding the rupture area exhibited higher aseismic fault slip rates before the earthquake and clear postseismic slip of up to 1.6 m within 9 months following the main shock. The frictional fault properties and complete relief of ambient stress in the central rupture zone of the main shock probably control the observed distribution. The postseismic slip shows a more abrupt increase in the region closer to the source, suggesting outwards propagation of afterslip.

  {"id":"Vasyura-Bathke.etal_2021_AccountingTheory","abstract":"Centroid moment tensor (CMT) parameters can be estimated from seismic waveforms. Since these data indirectly observe the deformation process, CMTs are inferred as solutions to inverse problems which are generally underdetermined and require signiﬁcant assumptions, including assumptions about data noise. Broadly speaking, we consider noise to include both theory and measurement errors, where theory errors are due to assumptions in the inverse problem and measurement errors are caused by the measurement process. While data errors are routinely included in parameter estimation for full CMTs, less attention has been paid to theory errors related to velocity-model uncertainties and how these affect the resulting moment-tensor (MT) uncertainties. Therefore, rigorous uncertainty quantiﬁcation for CMTs may require theoryerror estimation which becomes a problem of specifying noise models. Various noise models have been proposed, and these rely on several assumptions. All approaches quantify theory errors by estimating the covariance matrix of data residuals. However, this estimation can be based on explicit modelling, empirical estimation and/or ignore or include covariances. We quantitatively compare several approaches by presenting parameter and uncertainty estimates in nonlinear full CMT estimation for several simulated data sets and regional ﬁeld data of the Ml 4.4, 2015 June 13 Fox Creek, Canada, event. While our main focus is at regional distances, the tested approaches are general and implemented for arbitrary source model choice. These include known or unknown centroid locations, full MTs, deviatoric MTs and double-couple MTs. We demonstrate that velocity-model uncertainties can profoundly affect parameter estimation and that their inclusion leads to more realistic parameter uncertainty quantiﬁcation.

Here, we reduce uncertainty in mainshock source parameters with joint inference of interferometric synthetic aperture radar and seismic waveform data, showing that the mainshock nucleated at about 5-km depth, propagating up-dip toward the injection source, and arresting at about 2-km depth. With precise hypocenter relocations and Bayesian inference, we reveal that four subparallel faults were reactivated, likely part of a regional, basement-rooted graben system. The reactivated faults appear to be truncated by a conjugate fault that is misoriented for slip in the present-day stress regime. The nearest saltwater disposal well targets a permeable Devonian reef in direct contact with Precambrian basement, atop a ridge-like uplift. Our observations show that a fault system can be activated more than a decade after saltwater disposal initiation, and continued disposal may lead to a resurgence of seismicity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Vasyura-Bathke","given":"Hannes"},{"family":"Dettmer","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Biegel","given":"Katherine"},{"family":"Salvage","given":"Rebecca O."},{"family":"Eaton","given":"David"},{"family":"Ackerley","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Samsonov","given":"Sergey"},{"family":"Dahm","given":"Torsten"}],"citation-key":"Vasyura-Bathke.etal_2023_BayesianInference","container-title":"Communications Earth & Environment","container-title-short":"Commun Earth Environ","DOI":"10.1038/s43247-023-01064-1","ISSN":"2662-4435","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,3]]},"language":"en","license":"2023 The Author(s)","number":"1","page":"1-12","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Bayesian inference elucidates fault-system anatomy and resurgent earthquakes induced by continuing saltwater disposal","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-01064-1","volume":"4"},

(The point pattern itself has dimension zero.) Two possible interpretations are described. In the first of these, the observation region is regarded as being held fixed, while observations accumulate with time. In this case, provided the process is stationary and ergodic in time, and the cumulants satisfy certain regularity constraints, the dimension estimates consistently estimate the Rényi moment dimensions of the marginal distribution in space. If the regularity constraints are not satisfied, then different limits can be obtained according to the manner in which the limits are taken. In the second case, the process is regarded as being stationary and ergodic in its spatial component, time being held fixed. In this case the estimates provide consistent estimates of the initial power-law rates of growth of the moment measures of the Palm distribution, the estimates for successively higher Rényi dimensions estimating the growth rates for successively higher-order moment measures of the Palm distribution. Several examples are given, to illustrate the different types of behaviour which may occur, including the case where the points are generated by a dynamical system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Vere-Jones","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"Vere-Jones_1999_FractalDimensions","container-title":"Advances in Applied Probability","DOI":"10.1239/aap/1029955197","ISSN":"0001-8678","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999"]]},"note":"ZSCC:00015","page":"643-663","publisher":"Applied Probability Trust","source":"JSTOR","title":"On the Fractal Dimensions of Point Patterns","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1428389","volume":"31"},

Therefore, good constraints on the relative plate rates and directions, and on possible intraplate deformation, are crucial to assess the seismic hazard at the boundaries of the Arabian plate and areas within it. Here we combine GNSS-derived velocities from 168 stations located on the Arabian plate with a regional kinematic block model to provide updated estimates of the present-day motion and internal deformation of the plate. A single Euler pole at 50.93 ± 0.15°N, 353.91 ± 0.25°E with a rotation rate of 0.524 ± 0.001°/Ma explains well almost all the GNSS station velocities relative to the ITRF14 reference frame, confirming the large-scale rigidity of the plate. Internal strain rates at the plate-wide scale (∼0.4 nanostrain/yr) fall within the limits for stable plate interiors, indicating that differential motions are compensated for internally, which further supports the coherent rigid motion of the Arabian plate at present. At a smaller scale, however, we identified several areas within the plate that accommodate strain rates of up to ∼8 nanostrain/yr. Anthropogenic activity and possible subsurface magmatic activity near the western margin of the Arabian plate are likely responsible for the observed local internal deformation. Put together, our results show a remarkable level of stability for the Arabian lithosphere, which can withstand the long-term load forces associated with active continental collision in the northeast and breakup to the southwest with minimal internal deformation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Viltres","given":"Renier"},{"family":"Jónsson","given":"Sigurjón"},{"family":"Alothman","given":"Abdulaziz"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Shaozhuo"},{"family":"Leroy","given":"Sylvie"},{"family":"Masson","given":"Frédéric"},{"family":"Doubre","given":"Cécile"},{"family":"Reilinger","given":"Robert"}],"citation-key":"Viltres.etal_2022_PresentdayMotion","container-title":"Tectonics","DOI":"10.1029/2021TC007013","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"page":"e2021TC007013","publisher":"American Geophysical Union (AGU)","source":"HAL Archives Ouvertes","title":"Present-day motion of the Arabian plate","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03624188","volume":"41"},

  {"id":"Wald.etal_1906_SOURCESTUDY","abstract":"All quality teleseismic recordings of the great 1906 San Francisco earthquake archived in the 1908 Carnegie Report by the State Earthquake Investigation Commission were scanned and digitized. First order results were obtained by comparing complexity and amplitudes of teleseismic waveforms from the 1906 earthquake with well calibrated, similarly located, more recent earthquakes (1979 Coyote Lake, 1984 Morgan Hill, and 1989 Loma Prieta earthquakes) at nearly co-located modern stations. Peak amplitude ratios for calibration events indicated that a localized moment release of about 1 to 1.5 × 1027 dyne-cm was responsible for producing the peak the teleseismic body wave arrivals. At longer periods (50 to 80 sec), we found spectral amplitude ratios of the surface waves require a total moment release between 4 and 6 × 1027 dyne-cm for the 1906 earthquake, comparable to previous geodetic and surface wave estimates (Thatcher, 1975). We then made a more detailed source analysis using Morgan Hill S body waves as empirical Green's Functions in a finite fault subevent summation. The Morgan Hill earthquake was deemed most appropriate for this purpose as its mechanism is that of the 1906 earthquake in the central portion of the rupture. From forward and inverse empirical summations of Morgan Hill Green's functions, we obtained a good fit to the best quality teleseismic waveforms with a relatively simple source model having two regions of localized strong radiation separated spatially by about 110 km. Assuming the 1906 epicenter determined by Bolt (1968), this corresponds with a large asperity (on the order of the Loma Prieta earthquake) in the Golden Gate/San Francisco region and one about three times larger located northwest along strike between Point Reyes and Fort Ross. This model implies that much of the 1906 rupture zone may have occurred with relatively little 10 to 20 sec radiation. Consideration of the amplitude and frequency content of the 1906 teleseismic data allowed us to estimate the scale length of the largest asperity to be less than about 40 km. With rough constraints on the largest asperity (size and magnitude) we produced a suite of estimated synthetic ground velocities assuming a slip distribution similar to that of the Loma Prieta earthquake but with three times as much slip. For purposes of comparison with the recent, abundant Loma Prieta strong motion data set, we \"moved\" the largest 1906 asperity into Loma Prieta region. Peak ground velocity amplitudes are substantially greater than those recorded during the Loma Prieta earthquake, and are comparable to those predicted by the attenuation relationship of Joyner and Boore (1988) for a magnitude M w = 7.7 earthquake.","author":[{"family":"Wald","given":"David J"},{"family":"Kanamori","given":"Hiroo"},{"family":"Helmberger","given":"Donaldv"},{"family":"Heaton","given":"Thomas H"}],"citation-key":"Wald.etal_1906_SOURCESTUDY","issued":{"date-parts":[["1906"]]},"language":"en","page":"39","source":"Zotero","title":"SOURCE STUDY OF THE 1906 SAN FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE","type":"article-journal"},

The location method incorporates ordinary absolute travel-time measurements and/or cross-correlation P-and S-wave differential travel-time measurements. Residuals between observed and theoretical travel-time differences (or double-differences) are minimized for pairs of earthquakes at each station while linking together all observed event-station pairs. A least-squares solution is found by iteratively adjusting the vector difference between hypocentral pairs. The double-difference algorithm minimizes errors due to unmodeled velocity structure without the use of station corrections. Because catalog and cross-correlation data are combined into one system of equations, interevent distances within multiplets are determined to the accuracy of the cross-correlation data, while the relative locations between multiplets and uncorrelated events are simultaneously determined to the accuracy of the absolute travel-time data. Statistical resampling methods are used to estimate data accuracy and location errors. Uncertainties in double-difference locations are improved by more than an order of magnitude compared to catalog locations. The algorithm is tested, and its performance is demonstrated on two clusters of earthquakes located on the northern Hayward fault, California. There it collapses the diffuse catalog locations into sharp images of seismicity and reveals horizontal lineations of hypocenters that deﬁne the narrow regions on the fault where stress is released by brittle failure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Waldhauser","given":"F."}],"citation-key":"Waldhauser_2000_DoubleDifferenceEarthquake","container-title":"Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America","container-title-short":"Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America","DOI":"10.1785/0120000006","ISSN":"0037-1106","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1353-1368","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A Double-Difference Earthquake Location Algorithm: Method and Application to the Northern Hayward Fault, California","title-short":"A Double-Difference Earthquake Location Algorithm","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/bssa/article/90/6/1353-1368/120565","volume":"90"},

Waveforms of new events are automatically cross correlated with those archived for nearby past events to measure accurate differential phase arrival times. These data, together with delay times computed from arrival time picks, are subsequently inverted for the vector connecting the new event to its neighboring events using the double-difference algorithm. The new seismic monitoring technique is applied to earthquakes recorded in northern California, using near-real-time data feeds from the Northern California Seismic Network (NCSN) and the Northern California Earthquake Data Center, and a locally stored copy of the NCSN seismic archive. New events are automatically relocated in near-real time (tens of seconds) relative to a high-resolution double-difference earthquake catalog for northern California. Back testing using past events across northern California indicates that the real-time solutions are on average within 0.08 km laterally and 0.24 km vertically of the double-difference catalog locations. We show that the precision with which new events are located using this technique will improve with time, helped by the continued increase in density of recorded earthquakes and growth of the digital seismic archives.

Some calderas are downsagged structures, a fact deduced mainly from the backtilting of ignimbrite sheets assumed originally to have possessed an outwardly directed slope. Few calderas have postcaldera vent rings; postcaldera vents more commonly lie on a transverse line, occupy a central position, or are scattered, indicating that any possible caldera ring faults were not sufficiently significant lines of weakness to guide uprising magmas. About as many volcanoes have vent rings outside the caldera as inside, and vent rings are known also where caldera faults are lacking. These and other lines of evidence suggest that vent rings on intermediate or silicic volcanoes are more likely to be situated on cone sheet?type fractures, caused by upwardly directed magmatic pressure and related to updoming, than on ring faults related to caldera subsidence. The prevailing view of caldera formation is a catastrophic one, but some calderas grow incrementally in response to a succession of moderatesized eruptions. On some volcanoes having a small caldera, the present caldera may be merely the youngest of a succession generated by relatively small?magnitude events. Attention is drawn to the fact that cauldrons and ring?dike complexes are a feature of intracontinental cratonic volcanoes. It is significant that the anomalously large Tertiary calderas of the Basin and Range Province, which conform more closely to the currently favored caldera model than do the calderas in epicontinental settings, also cut Precambrian crust.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Walker","given":"George P.

This approach allows us to estimate the distribution of interseismic coupling on the subduction zone interface beneath the North Island and the kinematics of the tectonic block rotations. In agreement with previous studies we find that the subduction zone interface beneath the southern North Island has a high slip rate deficit during the interseismic period, and the slip rate deficit decreases northward along the margin. Much of the North Island is rotating as several, distinct tectonic blocks (clockwise at 0.5–3.8 deg Myr−1) about nearby axes relative to the Australian Plate. This rotation accommodates much of the margin-parallel component of motion between the Pacific and Australian plates. On the basis of our estimation of the block kinematics we suggest that rotation of the eastern North Island occurs because of the southward increasing thickness of the subducting Hikurangi Plateau. These results have implications for our understanding of convergent margin plate boundary zones around the world, particularly with regard to our knowledge of mechanisms for rapid tectonic block rotations at convergent margins and the role of block rotations in the slip partitioning process.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Wallace","given":"Laura M."},{"family":"Beavan","given":"John"},{"family":"McCaffrey","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Darby","given":"Desmond"}],"citation-key":"Wallace.etal_2004_SubductionZone","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/2004JB003241","ISSN":"2156-2202","issue":"B12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004"]]},"language":"en","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Subduction zone coupling and tectonic block rotations in the North Island, New Zealand","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2004JB003241","volume":"109"},

We evaluate characteristic structures resulting from doming (chamber inflation), evacuation collapse (chamber deflation) and cyclic resurgence (inflation and deflation), and we analyse the consequential fault patterns and their statistical relationship to morphology and geometry. Doming results in radial fractures and subordinate concentric reverse faults which propagate divergently from the chamber upwards with increasing dilation. The structural dome so produced is characterised bysteepening in the periphery, whereas the broadening apex subsides. Pure evacuation causes the chamber roof to collapse along adjacent bell-shaped reverse faults. The distribution of concentric faults is influenced by the initial edifice morphology; steep and irregular initial flanks result in a tilted or chaotic caldera floor. The third set of experiments focused on the structural interaction of cyclic inflation and subsequent moderate deflation. Following doming, caldera subsidence produces concentric faults that characteristically crosscut radial cracks of the dome. The flanks of the edifice relax, resulting in discontinuous circumferential faults that outline a structural network of radial and concentric faults; the latter form locally uplifted and tiltedwedges (half-grabens) that grade into horst-and-graben structures. This superimposed fault pattern also extends inside the caldera. We suggest that major pressure deviations in magma chamber(s) are reflected in the fault arrangement dissecting the volcanoflanks and may be used as a first-order indication of the processes and mechanisms involved in caldera formation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Walter","given":"Thomas R."},{"family":"Troll","given":"Valentin R."}],"citation-key":"Walter.Troll_2001_FormationCaldera","container-title":"Bulletin of Volcanology","container-title-short":"Bull Volcanol","DOI":"10.1007/s004450100135","ISSN":"0258-8900, 1432-0819","issue":"2-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"191","source":"link.springer.com","title":"Formation of caldera periphery faults: an experimental study","title-short":"Formation of caldera periphery faults","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004450100135","volume":"63"},
  {"id":"Wang_2007_17Elastic","abstract":"An ideal model of subduction earthquake cycles that includes tectonic loading, rate-dependent friction, and viscoelastic stress relaxation is not yet available. For comparison with geodetic observations, the most widely used models treat fault motion in a purely kinematical fashion, that is, the fault slip (or state of locking) is estimated from surface observations regardless of the loading mechanism and frictional properties. These include forward and inverse elastic dislocation and viscoelastic models. Without addressing the loading mechanism, extra care should be taken to ensure that the assigned or estimated fault motion is physically valid. Time dependence is an important aspect of interseismic deformation, although it is often difficult to distinguish between contributions from time-dependent fault motion and from stress relaxation of the upper mantle. A brief review of modeling work for the Cascadia margin is provided to demonstrate the advantages and limitations of the elastic and viscoelastic models and to explain a number of practical issues.

Elastic models can also fit most of the Cascadia geodetic observations but by assuming that all deformation is due to current fault motion.

Over the past two decades, space geodesy has revolutionized our view of crustal deformation between consecutive earthquakes. The short time span of modern measurements necessitates comparative studies of subduction zones that are at different stages of the deformation cycle. Piecing together geodetic ‘snapshots’ from different subduction zones leads to a unifying picture in which the deformation is controlled by both the short-term (years) and long-term (decades and centuries) viscous behaviour of the mantle.

In some cases, however, the ESD refinement fails to align the bursts in Sentinel-1 interferograms, possibly because of ionospheric propagation effects.

  {"id":"Wang.etal_2024_MultiframeDeformation","abstract":"Wide-area deformation measurements require multi-frame InSAR datasets for joint monitoring due to the limited swath width of SAR images. However, variations in the stability of reference points, error signal magnitude and distribution, and spatio-temporal filtering parameters result in different deformation rates between adjacent frames, leading to centimeter-level errors in the results. To obtain spatially consistent wide-area results, here we propose a multi-frame deformation velocity splicing method that combines InSAR datasets and block adjustment. We convert the line-of-sight deformation of each frame to vertical using an improved vertical deformation solution method. We construct an uncontrolled block adjustment model and use the results in the automatically identified overlapping areas as redundant observations to solve the deviation of each frame in a wide area. Finally, the multi-frame seamless results are sampled into a uniform spatial resolution cell network, to generate a wide-area deformation product with consistent reference. We validate the proposed method in Guangdong Province, China, covering an area of 1.96 × 105 km2. By correcting and fusing a total of 78 ALOS-1/PALSAR frames (2007–2010) and 11 Sentinel-1 frames (2015–2021) separately, we obtain the wide-area deformation products for Guangdong during the two periods. Compared with the original results, the inner precision of the ALOS-1/PALSAR and Sentinel-1 data is improved by 82.4% and 73.7%, respectively. Compared with GNSS, the accuracy of the corrected Sentinel-1 results is improved by more than 19%.

  {"id":"Wang.Zhu_2016_RobustEstimators","abstract":"This paper introduces a framework for robust parameter estimation in multipass interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), such as persistent scatterer interferometry, SAR tomography, small baseline subset, and SqueeSAR. These techniques involve estimation of phase history parameters with or without covariance matrix estimation. Typically, their optimal estimators are derived on the assumption of stationary complex Gaussian-distributed observations. However, their statistical robustness has not been addressed with respect to observations with nonergodic and non-Gaussian multivariate distributions. The proposed robust InSAR optimization (RIO) framework answers two fundamental questions in multipass InSAR: 1) how to optimally treat images with a large phase error, e.g., due to unmolded motion phase, uncompensated atmospheric phase, etc.; and 2) how to estimate the covariance matrix of a non-Gaussian complex InSAR multivariate, particularly those with nonstationary phase signals. For the former question, RIO employs a robust M-estimator to effectively downweight these images; and for the latter, we propose a new method, i.e., the rank M-estimator, which is robust against non-Gaussian distribution. Furthermore, it can work without the assumption of sample stationarity, which is a topic that has not previously been addressed. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed framework for data with large phase error and heavily tailed distribution, by comparing it with state-of-the-art estimators for persistent and distributed scatterers. Substantial improvement can be achieved in terms of the variance of estimates. The proposed framework can be easily extended to other multipass InSAR techniques, particularly to those where covariance matrix estimation is vital.","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Yuanyuan"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Xiao Xiang"}],"citation-key":"Wang.Zhu_2016_RobustEstimators","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","DOI":"10.1109/TGRS.2015.2471303","ISSN":"1558-0644","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",2]]},"note":"ZSCC:00059","page":"968-980","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Robust Estimators for Multipass SAR Interferometry","type":"article-journal","volume":"54"},

Analysis of the GPS measurements with respect to the ITRF2000 Reference Frame yields time series of daily site positions containing both secular and seasonal variations. Horizontal secular variations (station velocities) are evaluated with respect to the main tectonic element in the region, the DSF. We use six velocity vectors west of the DSF to define the ITRF2000 pole of the Sinai sub-plate, and rotate the velocity field for all stations into the Sinai reference frame (SRF). The velocity vectors reveal that (1) relative station movements are less than 4 mm/yr; (2) the nine stations located west of the DSF show no statistically significant motion with respect to the SRF; and (3) the two stations located in the Golan Heights (KATZ and ELRO) and a station in Damascus, Syria (UDMC) show 1.7–2.8 mm/yr northward motion with respect to Sinai, indicating a left-lateral motion along the DSF. Using locked-fault models, we estimate the current slip rate across the DSF as 3.3 ± 0.4 mm/yr. If we exclude the northern sites (ELRO and UDMC), which are located adjacent to the compressional jog of Mount Hermon, our estimate increases to 3.7 ± 0.4 mm/yr.

  {"id":"Weinstein.etal_2020_ImpactDead","abstract":"The Dead Sea Transform (DST) cuts through the northwestern edge of the Harrat ash Shaam volcanic ﬁeld of western Arabia. The relation of the DST to adjacent volcanic activity has varied during the last 5 Ma. While Pliocene volcanism erupted on both shoulders of the DST and thick sections of volcanics accumulated along its axis, Pleistocene volcanic activity gradually abandoned the transform area while continued farther east. This was concomitant with the increase of transform‐normal (E‐W) contraction along the adjacent transpressive Metulla block at the DST northern sector. New geochronology of Pleistocene volcanic rocks from the Golan Heights (Ar‐Ar) and of syntectonic and post‐tectonic calcite precipitates (U‐Th) from Metulla block reveals temporal association of volcanic dormancy and intensity of the transpressive regime. This includes volcanic cessations during 600–220 ka and post 100 ka, which coincided with growth episodes of several ~E‐W striking veins within the adjacent Metulla block. New high‐resolution U‐Th ages of calcite‐ﬁlled vein record the exact timing of these growth episodes to 340–240 and 53–16 ka, which is in accordance with the renewed activity along N‐S strike‐slip faults during 220–60 ka, manifested by U‐Th ages of calcite precipitates on striated fault planes. The temporal association of volcanic dormancy and enhanced transpression, while volcanic activity and increased strike‐slip activity, suggests that continental transforms may act both as inhibitors and as facilitators to magmatic activity. Switching between intermediate and least principal stresses might be the underline mechanism for stress dissipation and relaxation at a time scale of 100 ka. Plain Language Summary The Dead Sea Transform (DST), a plate boundary fault running 1,000 km from the northwestern tip of the Red Sea toward Turkey, cuts through the northern part of the large volcanic area of Harrat ash Shaam in western Arabia. We show that although not being a driving force for the volcanism itself, the stress ﬁeld associated with the DST occasionally facilitated volcanism along its axis and shoulders, while in other times (e.g., Recent), it functioned as an inhibitor to volcanism, which during the Pleistocene caused activity to abandon the DST area and migrate eastward, toward the center of the Harrat ash Shaam volcanic ﬁeld.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Weinstein","given":"Y."},{"family":"Nuriel","given":"P."},{"family":"Inbar","given":"M."},{"family":"Jicha","given":"B.

  {"id":"Wells.Coppersmith_1994_NewEmpirical","abstract":"Source parameters for historical earthquakes worldwide are compiled to develop a series of empirical relationships among moment magnitude (M), surface rupture length, subsurface rupture length, downdip rupture width, rupture area, and maximum and average displacement per event. The resulting data base is a significant update of previous compilations and includes the additional source parameters of seismic moment, moment magnitude, subsurface rupture length, downdip rupture width, and average surface displacement. Each source parameter is classified as reliable or unreliable, based on our evaluation of the accuracy of individual values. Only the reliable source parameters are used in the final analyses. In comparing source parameters, we note the following trends: (1) Generally, the length of rupture at the surface is equal to 75% of the subsurface rupture length; however, the ratio of surface rupture length to subsurface rupture length increases with magnitude; (2) the average surface displacement per event is about one-half the maximum surface displacement per event; and (3) the average subsurface displacement on the fault plane is less than the maximum surface displacement but more than the average surface displacement. Thus, for most earthquakes in this data base, slip on the fault plane at seismogenic depths is manifested by similar displacements at the surface. Log-linear regressions between earthquake magnitude and surface rupture length, subsurface rupture length, and rupture area are especially well correlated, showing standard deviations of 0.25 to 0.35 magnitude units. Most relationships are not statistically different (at a 95% significance level) as a function of the style of faulting: thus, we consider the regressions for all slip types to be appropriate for most applications. Regressions between magnitude and displacement, magnitude and rupture width, and between displacement and rupture length are less well correlated and have larger standard deviation than regressions between magnitude and length or area. The large number of data points in most of these regressions and their statistical stability suggest that they are unlikely to change significantly in response to additional data. Separating the data according to extensional and compressional tectonic environments neither provides statistically different results nor improves the statistical significance of the regressions. Regressions for cases in which earthquake magnitude is either the independent or the dependent parameter can be used to estimate maximum earthquake magnitudes both for surface faults and for subsurface seismic sources such as blind faults, and to estimate the expected surface displacement along a fault for a given size earthquake.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Wells","given":"Donald L."},{"family":"Coppersmith","given":"Kevin J."}],"citation-key":"Wells.Coppersmith_1994_NewEmpirical","container-title":"Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America","container-title-short":"Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America","DOI":"10.1785/BSSA0840040974","ISSN":"0037-1106","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1994",8,1]]},"page":"974-1002","source":"Silverchair","title":"New empirical relationships among magnitude, rupture length, rupture width, rupture area, and surface displacement","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1785/BSSA0840040974","volume":"84"},

Additionally, there are three operating geothermal power plants in this region, known as the Sevier thermal area. This setting is very similar to that found in the Coso geothermal area. However, the source and lateral extent of subsurface heat in Utah is poorly understood.

The final 3D model has many similarities to imaged velocity models at the Coso geothermal area.

  {"id":"Wesson_1988_DynamicsFault","abstract":"Observations along the surface traces of active faults in California and elsewhere indicate that tectonic displacement can occur as seismic slip or as aseismic fault creep. Fault creep occurs as secular displacement and as displacement episodes, called “creep events,” which last a few hours to days and include from a millimeter or less to a few tens of millimeters of displacement. Instrumental measurements of displacement versus time during creep events show that many events have a characteristic, simple form, including a steep beginning, followed by a gradual decay in the rate of displacement. Some creep events display small amounts of precursory slip, and many seem to be composed of several discrete “simple” events. Propagation of creep events along the San Andreas, Calaveras, and Imperial faults in California has been inferred from the nearly simultaneous observation of creep events at nearby creepmeters and from kinematic modeling of continuous measurements of strain during creep events. Fault creep can be viewed as arising from the interplay of three factors: stress applied to the fault from external sources; stress caused by the geometry and distribution of displacement on the fault, arising from the elastic response of the surrounding medium to the displacements within the anelastic fault zone itself; and the constitutive relations characterizing the resistance to slip on the fault. Analytic solutions are presented for a simple, rectangular dislocation, quasi-static model of nonpropagating fault creep assuming viscous and quasi-plastic (power law creep) fault zone rheology and for a multi-element (composed of several rectangular or striplike dislocation surfaces), quasi-static model assuming a viscous rheology. Viscous rheology implies solutions composed of exponentials that decay with time. The simple, one-element, quasi-plastic model is in agreement with the form of creep events observed at Melendy Ranch, California. A matrix formulation is presented to calculate dislocation stresses on a fault zone in a half-space or plate. The formulation involves the division of the dislocation surface into strips or rectangles and the use of published solutions to calculate the stress resulting from displacement on each individual element. Results from the matrix method agree with analytic results for equilibrium displacements on “stress-free” cracks. The matrix formulation is then used as the basis for a numerical method to simulate one- and two-dimensional propagating creep assuming a quasi-plastic rheology on the fault zone. Results from this method agree reasonably well with observations of afterslip from the 1966 Parkfield, 1975 Oroville, and 1979 Imperial Valley, California, earthquakes and of a propagating creep event observed along the southern Calaveras fault, central California, during July 1977. This method of analysis, and the assumption that creep at each point on the fault zone follows a power law rheology after the applied stress reaches a spatially varying yield stress, can explain the secular and episodic nature of fault creep; afterslip; the simple shape of some individual events and the multiple, composite shape of others; and the propagation of creep events. On the southern Calaveras fault, observations of propagating creep indicate a yield stress near zero at the surface and throughout much of the fault zone. However, they also indicate the presence of a zone at a depth of about 0.5 km, and about 5 km long, with a yield stress of about 15 bars (1.5 MPa). The methods of solution presented here should be applicable to many problems in the dynamics of faulting.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Wesson","given":"Robert L."}],"citation-key":"Wesson_1988_DynamicsFault","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/JB093iB08p08929","ISSN":"2156-2202","issue":"B8","issued":{"date-parts":[["1988"]]},"language":"en","page":"8929-8951","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Dynamics of fault creep","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JB093iB08p08929","volume":"93"},
  {"id":"Westerhaus.etal_2010_ApplicationCBand","abstract":"During the last 15 years the water level of the Dead Sea dropped almost linearly at a rate of about 1m/year, equivalent to a mass loss of 7 x 1011 kg/year. The Earth's crust is supposed to respond to the mass removal by (visco)elastic rebound. From simple a piori model calculations an uplift rate of the order of 1.5 mm/year near the shores of the Dead Sea is expected. We use SAR interferometry as well as Small Baseline- and PSapproaches to verify the response of the Earth to unloading and to determine the spatial and temporal uplift pattern in the environs of the Dead Sea. The first results presented here are encouraging: average profiles across the Dead Sea show a tendency towards higher velocities in the vicinity of the Dead Sea. This velocity trend fits reasonably to the anticipated crustal unloading signal, both in amplitude and spatial extension. It is, however, so far not significant in terms of uncertainty measures and needs further verification.","author":[{"family":"Westerhaus","given":"Malte"},{"family":"Kuny","given":"Silvia"},{"family":"Schenk","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Ben-Avraham","given":"Zvi"},{"family":"Heidbach","given":"Oliver"}],"citation-key":"Westerhaus.etal_2010_ApplicationCBand","container-title":"The 2010 ESA Living Planet Symposium","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC:00000","source":"Zotero","title":"Application of C-Band Interferometry to Investigate Crustal Unloading Around the Dead Sea","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"Westoby.etal_2012_StructurefromMotionPhotogrammetry","abstract":"High-resolution topographic surveying is traditionally associated with high capital and logistical costs, so that data acquisition is often passed on to specialist third party organisations. The high costs of data collection are, for many applications in the earth sciences, exacerbated by the remoteness and inaccessibility of many ﬁeld sites, rendering cheaper, more portable surveying platforms (i.e. terrestrial laser scanning or GPS) impractical. This paper outlines a revolutionary, low-cost, user-friendly photogrammetric technique for obtaining high-resolution datasets at a range of scales, termed ‘Structure-from-Motion’ (SfM). Traditional softcopy photogrammetric methods require the 3-D location and pose of the camera(s), or the 3-D location of ground control points to be known to facilitate scene triangulation and reconstruction. In contrast, the SfM method solves the camera pose and scene geometry simultaneously and automatically, using a highly redundant bundle adjustment based on matching features in multiple overlapping, offset images. A comprehensive introduction to the technique is presented, followed by an outline of the methods used to create high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) from extensive photosets obtained using a consumer-grade digital camera. As an initial appraisal of the technique, an SfM-derived DEM is compared directly with a similar model obtained using terrestrial laser scanning. This intercomparison reveals that decimetre-scale vertical accuracy can be achieved using SfM even for sites with complex topography and a range of land-covers. Example applications of SfM are presented for three contrasting landforms across a range of scales including; an exposed rocky coastal cliff; a breached moraine-dam complex; and a glacially-sculpted bedrock ridge. The SfM technique represents a major advancement in the ﬁeld of photogrammetry for geoscience applications. Our results and experiences indicate SfM is an inexpensive, effective, and ﬂexible approach to capturing complex topography.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Westoby","given":"M.J."},{"family":"Brasington","given":"J."},{"family":"Glasser","given":"N.F."},{"family":"Hambrey","given":"M.J."},{"family":"Reynolds","given":"J.M."}],"citation-key":"Westoby.etal_2012_StructurefromMotionPhotogrammetry","container-title":"Geomorphology","container-title-short":"Geomorphology","DOI":"10.1016/j.geomorph.2012.08.021","ISSN":"0169555X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",12]]},"language":"en","page":"300-314","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"‘Structure-from-Motion’ photogrammetry: A low-cost, effective tool for geoscience applications","title-short":"‘Structure-from-Motion’ photogrammetry","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169555X12004217","volume":"179"},

Here we show that aquifer pressure data, interferometric synthetic aperture radar surface deformation time series, and seismic monitoring suggest that groundwater withdrawal triggered these earthquakes. Continuous groundwater extraction from several wells located ~10 km west of the swarms has accelerated since 2010 and resulted in a total decrease of ~50 m of the groundwater level at the time of the 2018 earthquake swarm. The withdrawal also corresponds to surface subsidence of ~10 mm/year based on repeat interferometric synthetic aperture radar measurements. The temporal correlation, extensive subsidence, anomalous swarm characteristics, and normal faulting orientation suggest a connection between the groundwater withdrawal and recent earthquakes. Poroelastic modeling demonstrates that pumping‐induced pore pressure decrease west of the earthquake could have caused significant dilatational stresses that led to normal faulting events outside the aquifer.","author":[{"family":"Wetzler","given":"Nadav"},{"family":"Shalev","given":"Eyal"},{"family":"Göbel","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Amelung","given":"Falk"},{"family":"Kurzon","given":"Ittai"},{"family":"Lyakhovsky","given":"Vladimir"},{"family":"Brodsky","given":"Emily E."}],"citation-key":"Wetzler.etal_2019_EarthquakeSwarms","container-title":"Geophysical Research Letters","DOI":"10.1029/2019gl083491","issue":"14","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",7,28]]},"note":"ZSCC:00030\nMAG ID: 2962128010\nS2ID: df381a3d4126afca75c90b6a2589a6d67da5916f","page":"8056-8063","title":"Earthquake Swarms Triggered by Groundwater Extraction Near the Dead Sea Fault","type":"article-journal","volume":"46"},
  {"id":"Wetzler.Kurzon_2016_EarthquakeActivity","abstract":"More than 15,000 seismic events were recorded by the Israel Seismic Network (ISN) during the past 30 years, at the vicinity of the Dead Sea fault (DSF) zone. During those years, locations were obtained using several velocity models, which resulted in inconsistent locations. In addition, we found that seismicity is biased to very shallow depth estimations that do not match other estimations of more localized studies in the region. This study is focused on improving the regional earthquake catalog using robust single‐event location software (within the Antelope software), based on two seismic velocity models: (1) a local model (Gitterman et al., 2005) and (2) a global model (Kennett and Engdahl, 1991). The relocated events show more reasonable depth distributions, in accordance with the seismotectonic settings of the region, and the local velocity model shows smaller location errors than the global velocity model, suggesting better convergence of the location solutions. We also demonstrate and analyze the difference in the event‐station distribution, showing location effects of a sparse network, in which the main effect is seen for the focal depths: events located out of the network coverage tend to obtain a focal depth shallower than events located within the network coverage. The depth cross section along the DSF zone, within the boundaries of this study, presents a good correlation with previous estimation of the boundaries of the seismogenic zone, obtained by heat‐flow analysis. The relocated earthquake catalog is regarded as the new initial robust locations of the seismic bulletin of the ISN and considered as the basis for future studies and for more elaborated relocations; it is open to the public and can be downloaded from the Geological Survey of Israel website at https://www.gsi.gov.il (last accessed December 2015).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Wetzler","given":"Nadav"},{"family":"Kurzon","given":"Ittai"}],"citation-key":"Wetzler.Kurzon_2016_EarthquakeActivity","container-title":"Seismological Research Letters","container-title-short":"Seismological Research Letters","DOI":"10.1785/0220150157","ISSN":"0895-0695","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",1,1]]},"note":"ZSCC:00038","page":"47-58","source":"Silverchair","title":"The Earthquake Activity of Israel: Revisiting 30 Years of Local and Regional Seismic Records along the Dead Sea Transform","title-short":"The Earthquake Activity of Israel","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1785/0220150157","volume":"87"},

  {"id":"Wiemer_2000_MinimumMagnitude","abstract":"We mapped the minimum magnitude of complete reporting, Mc, for Alaska, the western United States, and for the JUNEC earthquake catalog of Japan. Mc was estimated based on its departure from the linear frequency-magnitude relation of the 250 closest earthquakes to grid nodes, spaced 10 km apart. In all catalogs studied, Mc was strongly heterogeneous. In offshore areas the Mc was typically one unit of magnitude higher than onshore. On land also, Mc can vary by one order of magnitude over distance less than 50 km. We recommend that seismicity studies that depend on complete sets of small earthquakes should be limited to areas with similar Mc, or the minimum magnitude for the analysis has to be raised to the highest common value of Mc. We believe that the data quality, as reﬂected by the Mc level, should be used to deﬁne the spatial extent of seismicity studies where Mc plays a role. The method we use calculates the goodness of ﬁt between a power law ﬁt to the data and the observed frequency-magnitude distribution as a function of a lower cutoff of the magnitude data. Mc is deﬁned as the magnitude at which 90% of the data can be modeled by a power law ﬁt. Mc in the 1990s is approximately 1.2 ע 0.4 in most parts of California, 1.8 ע 0.4 in most of Alaska (Aleutians and Panhandle excluded), and at a higher level in the JUNEC catalog for Japan. Various sources, such as explosions and earthquake families beneath volcanoes, can lead to distributions that cannot be ﬁt well by power laws. For the Hokkaido region we demonstrate how neglecting the spatial variability of Mc can lead to erroneous assumptions about deviations from self-similarity of earthquake scaling.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Wiemer","given":"S."}],"citation-key":"Wiemer_2000_MinimumMagnitude","container-title":"Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America","container-title-short":"Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America","DOI":"10.1785/0119990114","ISSN":"0037-1106","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"859-869","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Minimum Magnitude of Completeness in Earthquake Catalogs: Examples from Alaska, the Western United States, and Japan","title-short":"Minimum Magnitude of Completeness in Earthquake Catalogs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/bssa/article/90/4/859-869/120531","volume":"90"},

We use a nearest-neighbor clustering algorithm to identify earthquake sequences in the global ISC-GEM catalog and the regional Southern California catalog. Using an inner-product-based pairwise measure of moment tensor similarity, we demonstrate that, in both catalogs, aftershocks are less similar to their respective mainshocks than foreshocks are. We interpret this effect, which we call moment tensor scattering, as evidence for widespread coseismic stress rotations. Moment tensor scattering is observable for a broad range of mainshock magnitudes in both catalogs. We further demonstrate that mainshock-aftershock similarity recovers logarithmically to pre-mainshock levels on decadal timescales. We conclude that moment tensor scattering is a generally observable feature of seismic sequences which may be useful in future work to discriminate between models of crustal strength.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Wilding","given":"John D."},{"family":"Ross","given":"Zachary E."}],"citation-key":"Wilding.Ross_2022_AftershockMoment","container-title":"Geophysical Research Letters","DOI":"10.1029/2022GL098473","ISSN":"1944-8007","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC:00001","page":"e2022GL098473","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Aftershock Moment Tensor Scattering","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2022GL098473","volume":"49"},

We compare the EMR method with three existing techniques, ﬁnding that EMR shows a superior performance when applied to synthetic test cases or real data from regional and global earthquake catalogues. This method, however, is also the most computationally intensive. Accurate knowledge of Mc is essential for many seismicity-based studies, and particularly for mapping out seismicity parameters such as the b-value of the Gutenberg-Richter relationship. By explicitly computing the uncertainties in Mc using a bootstrap approach, we show that uncertainties in b-values are larger than traditionally assumed, especially when considering small sample sizes.

We attempt to resolve the 3D displacements for the 23 October 2002 Nenana Mountain (Alaska) Earthquake. The north component's error is much larger than the signal, but proxies for eastward and vertical motion can be determined if the north component is assumed negligible.

In the past 35 years, about 80 km2 of land has been reclaimed from the sea in Shenzhen. In order to investigate coastal vertical land motions associated with land reclamation, we proposed an elaborated Point Target (PT) based Small Baseline Subset InSAR (SBAS-InSAR) strategy to process an ENVISAT ASAR ascending and descending orbits dataset both acquired from 2007 to 2010. This new strategy can not only select high density PTs but also generate a reliable InSAR measurement with full spatial resolution. The inter-comparison between InSAR-derived deformation velocities from different orbits shows a good self-consistency of the results extracted by the elaborated PT-based SBAS-InSAR strategy. The InSAR measurements show that the reclaimed land is undergoing remarkable coastal subsidence (up to 25 mm/year), especially at the Shenzhen Airport, Bao’an Center, Qianhai Bay and Shenzhen Bay. By analyzing the results together with land reclamation evolution, we conclude that the ground deformation is expected to continue in the near future, which will amplify the regional sea level rise.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Xu","given":"Bing"},{"family":"Feng","given":"Guangcai"},{"family":"Li","given":"Zhiwei"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Qijie"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Changcheng"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Rongan"}],"citation-key":"Xu.etal_2016_CoastalSubsidence","container-title":"Remote Sensing","container-title-short":"Remote Sensing","DOI":"10.3390/rs8080652","ISSN":"2072-4292","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",8,13]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC:00090","page":"652","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Coastal Subsidence Monitoring Associated with Land Reclamation Using the Point Target Based SBAS-InSAR Method: A Case Study of Shenzhen, China","title-short":"Coastal Subsidence Monitoring Associated with Land Reclamation Using the Point Target Based SBAS-InSAR Method","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/8/8/652","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"Xu.Sandwell_2020_AbsolutePhase","abstract":"Radar interferograms provide a map of the phase difference between the reference and repeat acquisitions modulo 2π . Under ideal conditions, the phase can be unwrapped to provide an absolute phase connection across the map, although there is always an unknown integer phase ambiguity (i.e., N2π ) for the entire map. Here, we demonstrate a practical time series method to solve for these integer ambiguities in order to recover the absolute phase change between the ﬁrst and last SAR images. An important ﬁrst step is to correct the phase of each SAR image for the well-known solid earth tide, which typically produces a line of sight offset ±150 mm, as well as, trends along and across each image of ∼20 mm. This tide correction signiﬁcantly reduces the noise in the InSAR time series, especially at the L-band. These tidally corrected interferograms are then unwrapped and used to solve for a set of integer ambiguities that achieves phase closure when summing around loops in the stack. There is an inﬁnite number of ambiguity combinations that achieve loop closure; thus, regularization is required. In contrast to previous studies that use a least-squares approach to ﬁnd the ambiguities, we adopt an L1-norm approach to ﬁnd the minimum number of ambiguity corrections needed to achieve loop closure. We note that the split-spectrum ionospheric correction can introduce Nπ ambiguities and suggest two approaches for correcting both N2π and Nπ ambiguities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Xu","given":"Xiaohua"},{"family":"Sandwell","given":"David T."}],"citation-key":"Xu.Sandwell_2020_AbsolutePhase","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","container-title-short":"IEEE Trans.

In interferometric wide swath (IW) mode, three subswaths imaged in the novel Terrain Observation by Progressive Scans (TOPS) SAR mode result in a total swath width of 250 km. S-1 has become the European workhorse for large area mapping and interferometric monitoring at medium resolution. The interferometric processing of TOPS data however requires special consideration of the signal properties, resulting from the ScanSAR-type burst imaging and the antenna beam steering in azimuth. The high Doppler rate in azimuth sets very stringent coregistration requirements, making the use of enhanced spectral diversity (ESD) necessary to obtain the required fine azimuth coregistration accuracy. Other unique aspects of processing IW data, such as azimuth spectral filtering, image resampling, and data deramping and reramping, are reviewed, giving a recipe-like description that enables the user community to use S-1 IW mode repeat-pass SAR data. Interferometric results from S-1A are provided, demonstrating the mapping capacity of the S-1 system and its interferometric suitability for geophysical applications. An interferometric evaluation of a coherent interferometric pair over Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia, is provided, where several aspects related to coregistration, deramping, and synchronization are analyzed. Additionally, a spatiotemporal evaluation of the along-track shifts, which are directly related to the orbital/instrument timing error, measured from the SAR data is shown, which justifies the necessity to refine the azimuth shifts with ESD.

  {"id":"Yang.Ben-Zion_2009_ObservationalAnalysis","abstract":"Aftershock sequences are commonly observed but their properties vary from region to region. Ben-Zion and Lyakhovsky developed a solution for aftershocks decay in a damage rheology model. The solution indicates that the productivity of aftershocks decreases with increasing value of a non-dimensional material parameter R, given by the ratio of timescale for brittle deformation to timescale for viscous relaxation. The parameter R is inversely proportional to the degree of seismic coupling and is expected to increase primarily with increasing temperature and also with existence of sedimentary rocks at seismogenic depth. To test these predictions, we use aftershock sequences from several southern California regions. We ﬁrst analyse properties of individual aftershock sequences generated by the 1992 Landers and 1987 Superstition Hills earthquakes. The results show that the ratio of aftershock productivities in these sequences spanning four orders of event magnitudes is similar to the ratio of the average heat ﬂow in the two regions. To perform stronger statistical tests, we systematically analyse the average properties of stacked aftershock sequences in ﬁve regions. In each region, we consider events with magnitudes between 4.0 and 6.0 to be main shocks. For each main shock, we consider events to be aftershocks if they occur in the subsequent 50 d, within a circular region that scales with the magnitude of the main shock and in the magnitude range between that of the main shock and 2 units lower. This procedure produces 28–196 aftershock sequences in each of the ﬁve regions. We stack the aftershock sequences in each region and analyse the properties of the stacked data. The results indicate that the productivities of the stacked sequences are inversely correlated with the heat ﬂow and existence of deep sedimentary covers, in agreement with the damage model predictions. Using the observed ratios of aftershock productivities, along with simple expressions based on the damage model, we estimate the relative values of the material parameter R and seismic coupling coefﬁcient in the different regions. The employed methodology for estimating the seismic coupling in different regions can be useful for seismic hazard studies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Yang","given":"Wenzheng"},{"family":"Ben-Zion","given":"Yehuda"}],"citation-key":"Yang.Ben-Zion_2009_ObservationalAnalysis","container-title":"Geophysical Journal International","DOI":"10.1111/j.1365-246X.2009.04145.x","ISSN":"0956540X, 1365246X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",5]]},"language":"en","page":"481-490","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Observational analysis of correlations between aftershock productivities and regional conditions in the context of a damage rheology model","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/gji/article-lookup/doi/10.1111/j.1365-246X.2009.04145.x","volume":"177"},

After the July 2019 M7.1 Ridgecrest earthquake, we converted an underground dark fiber across the city of Ridgecrest, CA, into a DAS array. The recorded aftershocks show substantial lateral variability in site amplification over only 8-km in distance. To understand the cause of such variability, we used three months of continuous data, dominated by traffic-generated seismic noise, to image near-surface structure along the fiber path. We find that the lateral variations of earthquake shaking correlate well with the shallow shear velocity model at sub-kilometer scales, in particular micro-basins filled with soft sediments.

Starting from a preliminary catalog, we relocate ~7900 events using TomoDD to better quantify their spatiotemporal behavior. Relocated aftershocks are mostly clustered in two groups. The ﬁrst is immediately above the major coseismic slip patch, partially overlapping with shallow afterslip. The second one is 50 km SE to the main shock nucleation point and near the terminus of coseismic rupture, in a zone that exhibited little resolvable afterslip. Using the relocated events as templates, we scan through the continuous recording from 29 June 2012 to 30 December 2012, detecting approximately 17 times more than template events. We ﬁnd 190 aftershocks in the ﬁrst half hour following the main shock, mostly along the plate interface. Later events become more scattered in location, showing moderate expansion in both alongtrench and downdip directions. From the detected catalog we identify 53 repeating aftershock clusters with mean cross-correlation values larger than 0.9, and indistinguishably intracluster event locations, suggesting slip on the same fault patch. Most repeating clusters occurred within the ﬁrst major aftershock group. Very few repeating clusters were found in the aftershock grouping along the southern edge of the Peninsula, which is not associated with substantial afterslip.

  {"id":"Yilmaz.etal_1998_GeologyQuaternary","abstract":"Following the collision along the Bitlis–Zagros suture, a north–south convergence between the Arabian Platform and Laurasia has continued uninterrupted until the present. As a result, the continental crust has been shortened, thickened and consequently elevated to form the Turkish–Iranian high plateau. On the high plateau volcanic activity began during the Neogene, intensified during the late Miocene–Pliocene and continued until historical times. Large volcanic centres have been developed during the Quaternary which form significant peaks above the Turkish–Iranian high plateau. Among the Quaternary volcanoes, the major volcanic centres are Ararat, Tendürek, Suphan and Nemrut. Ararat (Ağri Daği) is the largest volcanic center and is a compound stratovolcano, consisting of Greater Ararat and lesser Ararat. The former represents the highest elevation of Anatolia reaching over 5000 m in height. Tendürek is a double-peaked shield volcano, which produced a voluminous amount of basalt lava as extensive pahoehoe, and aa flows. It has an ill-defined semi-caldera. Suphan is an isolated stratovolcano, capped by silicic dome. It represents the second highest topographic elevation in Anatolia, with a height of over 4000 m. A cluster of subsidiary cones and small domes surrounds the volcano. Nemrut is the largest member of a group of volcanoes, which trend north–south. It is a stratovolcano, having a well-defined collapse caldera and a caldera lake. Various volcanic ejecta have been extruded from these volcanic centres over the last 1 to 2 million years. The Quaternary volcanic centres, although temporally and spatially closely associated, display a wide range of lavas from basalt to rhyolite. The volcanoes have diverse compositional trends; Ararat is distinctly subalkaline, Suphan is mildly subalkaline, Nemrut is mildly alkaline and Tendürek is strongly alkaline. The major and trace element compositions together with the isotope ratios indicate that their magmas were generated from a heterogeneous mantle source. Each of the volcanic centres has undergone a partly different magmatic evolution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Yılmaz","given":"Y"},{"family":"Güner","given":"Y"},{"family":"Şaroğlu","given":"F"}],"citation-key":"Yilmaz.etal_1998_GeologyQuaternary","container-title":"Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research","container-title-short":"Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research","DOI":"10.1016/S0377-0273(98)00055-9","ISSN":"0377-0273","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1998",10,1]]},"page":"173-210","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Geology of the quaternary volcanic centres of the east Anatolia","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377027398000559","volume":"85"},

Several previous studies have addressed the importance of the elevation dependency of water vapor, but it is often a challenge to separate elevation-dependent tropospheric delays from turbulent components. In this paper, we present an iterative tropospheric decomposition interpolation model that decouples the elevation and turbulent tropospheric delay components. For a 150 km × 150 km California study region, we estimate real-time mode zenith total delays at 41 GPS stations over 1 year by using the precise point positioning technique and demonstrate that the decoupled interpolation model generates improved high-resolution tropospheric delay maps compared with previous tropospheric turbulence- and elevation-dependent models. Cross validation of the GPS zenith total delays yields an RMS error of 4.6 mm with the decoupled interpolation model, compared with 8.4 mm with the previous model. On converting the GPS zenith wet delays to precipitable water vapor and interpolating to 1 km grid cells across the region, validations with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer near-IR water vapor product show 1.7 mm RMS differences by using the decoupled model, compared with 2.0 mm for the previous interpolation model. Such results are obtained without differencing the tropospheric delays or water vapor estimates in time or space, while the errors are similar over flat and mountainous terrains, as well as for both inland and coastal areas.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Yu","given":"Chen"},{"family":"Penna","given":"Nigel T."},{"family":"Li","given":"Zhenhong"}],"citation-key":"Yu.etal_2017_GenerationRealtime","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres","DOI":"10.1002/2016JD025753","ISSN":"2169-8996","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","license":"©2017.

This poses more challenges for correcting interferograms for atmospheric effects since the spatial-temporal variations of tropospheric delay may dominate over large scales and completely mask the actual displacements due to tectonic or volcanic deformation. To overcome this, we have developed a generic interferometric synthetic aperture radar atmospheric correction model whose notable features comprise (i) global coverage, (ii) all-weather, all-time useability, (iii) correction maps available in near real time, and (iv) indicators to assess the correction performance and feasibility. The model integrates operational high-resolution European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) data (0.125° grid, 137 vertical levels, and 6-hr interval) and continuous GPS tropospheric delay estimates (every 5 min) using an iterative tropospheric decomposition model. The model's performance was tested using eight globally distributed Sentinel-1 interferograms, encompassing both flat and mountainous topographies, midlatitude and near polar regions, and monsoon and oceanic climate systems, achieving a phase standard deviation and displacement root-mean-square (RMS) of 1 cm against GPS over wide regions (250 by 250 km). Indicators describing the model's performance including (i) GPS network and ECMWF cross RMS, (ii) phase versus estimated atmospheric delay correlations, (iii) ECMWF time differences, and (iv) topography variations were developed to provide quality control for subsequent automatic processing and provide insights of the confidence level with which the generated atmospheric correction maps may be applied.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Yu","given":"Chen"},{"family":"Li","given":"Zhenhong"},{"family":"Penna","given":"Nigel T."},{"family":"Crippa","given":"Paola"}],"citation-key":"Yu.etal_2018_GenericAtmospheric","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/2017JB015305","ISSN":"2169-9356","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","license":"©2018.

  {"id":"Yu.etal_2018_InterferometricSynthetic","abstract":"Atmospheric effects represent one of the major error sources of repeat-pass Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), and could mask actual displacements due to tectonic or volcanic deformation. The tropospheric delays vary both vertically and laterally and can be considered as the sum of (i) a vertically stratified component highly correlated with topography and (ii) a turbulent component resulting from turbulent processes in the troposphere varying both in space and time. In this paper, we outline a framework to routinely use pointwise GPS data to reduce tropospheric effects on satellite radar measurements. An Iterative Tropospheric Decomposition (ITD) model is used and further developed to separate tropospheric stratified and turbulent signals and then generate high-resolution correction maps for SAR interferograms. Cross validation is employed to assess the performance of the ITD model and act as an indicator to users of when and where correction is feasible. Tests were carried out to assess the impact of GPS station spacing on the ITD model InSAR correction performance, which provides insights into the trade-off between station spacing and the achievable accuracy. The application of this framework to Sentinel-1A interferograms over the Southern California (USA) and Southern England (UK) regions shows approximately 45–78% of noise reduction even with a sparse (~50–80km station spacing) GPS network and/or with strong and non-random tropospheric turbulence. This is about a 50% greater improvement than previous methods. It is believed that this framework could lead to a generic InSAR atmospheric correction model while incorporating continuous and global tropospheric delay datasets, e.g. numerical weather models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Yu","given":"Chen"},{"family":"Li","given":"Zhenhong"},{"family":"Penna","given":"Nigel T."}],"citation-key":"Yu.etal_2018_InterferometricSynthetic","container-title":"Remote Sensing of Environment","container-title-short":"Remote Sensing of Environment","DOI":"10.1016/j.rse.2017.10.038","ISSN":"0034-4257","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,1]]},"page":"109-121","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Interferometric synthetic aperture radar atmospheric correction using a GPS-based iterative tropospheric decomposition model","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425717305011","volume":"204"},

Although evidence for coseismic slip on the Hikurangi subduction interface is controversial, we present afterslip on the subduction zone beneath Marlborough using 13 months of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and Global Positioning System (GPS) observations. The spatially and temporally correlated atmospheric errors in SAR interferograms are problematic, and hence a new InSAR time series approach, combining the Generic Atmospheric Correction Online Service (GACOS) with a spatial-temporal Atmospheric Phase Screen (APS) filter to facilitate the InSAR time series analysis, is developed. For interferograms with over 250 km spatial extent, we achieve a 0.77 cm displacement RMS difference against GPS, improving 61% from the conventional InSAR time series method (TS). Comparisons between the overlapping region of two independent tracks show an RMS difference of 1.1 cm for the TS-GACOS-APS combined method, improving 54% from the TS method and 27% from using TS with an APS filter only. The APS filter reduces the short wavelength residuals substantially, but fails to remove the long wavelength error even after the ramp removal, revealing that the GACOS correction has played a key role in mitigating long wavelength atmospheric effects. The resultant InSAR displacements, together with the GPS displacements, are used to recover the time-dependent afterslip distribution on the Hikurangi subduction interface, which provides insights for reviewing the co-seismic slip sources, the present status of the subduction plate boundary and future seismic hazards.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Yu","given":"Chen"},{"family":"Li","given":"Zhenhong"},{"family":"Penna","given":"Nigel T."}],"citation-key":"Yu.etal_2020_TriggeredAfterslip","container-title":"Remote Sensing of Environment","container-title-short":"Remote Sensing of Environment","DOI":"10.1016/j.rse.2020.112097","ISSN":"0034-4257","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12,15]]},"page":"112097","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Triggered afterslip on the southern Hikurangi subduction interface following the 2016 Kaikōura earthquake from InSAR time series with atmospheric corrections","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425720304703","volume":"251"},

Owing to the low signal‐to‐noise ratio, the seismic activities of DLFEs have not been characterized in detail; particularly, the linkage between DLFEs and shallow volcanic activity has not been understood sufﬁciently. In this study, numerous DLFEs have been successfully detected beneath the Hakone volcano, central Japan, by cross‐correlating a template to the continuous seismic signals. The resulting seismic catalog reveals that DLFEs are activated prior to notable earthquake swarms in the shallow part of a volcano and to the crustal expansion caused by a pressure source at a depth of 7 km. Results indicate that the activation of DLFEs reﬂects the feeding of magmatic ﬂuid from depth. The subsequent increment in the magmatic‐ﬂuid pressure triggers shallow volcanic activities. Plain Language Summary Deep low‐frequency earthquakes (DLFEs) are ubiquitous seismic activities in the deep parts of volcanoes. This deep seismicity provides potentially useful information for assessing volcanic hazards or forecasting eruptions because DLFE is thought to be related to deep magmatism. However, owing to its low signal‐to‐noise ratio, such seismic activity has not been characterized in detail; therefore, its linkage to shallow volcanic activity remains unclear. We studied the DLFEs beneath Hakone, which is an active volcano in central Japan, using the matched‐ﬁlter technique. We uncovered numerous DLFEs from seismic records spanning 17 years. We observed a statistically well‐supported correlation between the DLFE and shallow‐earthquake swarms/volcanic crustal deformation. Results revealed a recurring pattern of initially deep low‐frequency seismicity, followed by expansion of the volcanic ediﬁce and increasing shallow‐earthquake swarms. This sequence reﬂects the migration of magmatic‐ﬂuid pressure leading to volcanic events at the surface. These ﬁndings not only help scientiﬁc enquiry but also will be useful in mitigation of volcanic hazards because DLFE activation is the precursor of shallow volcanic events.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Yukutake","given":"Y."},{"family":"Abe","given":"Y."},{"family":"Doke","given":"R."}],"citation-key":"Yukutake.etal_2019_DeepLow","container-title":"Geophysical Research Letters","container-title-short":"Geophys.

We estimate the geometry of the sill assuming a horizontal, uniformly pressurized crack with unknown periphery and depth. The sill is discretized into small elements that are either open and are subjected to the pressure boundary condition or remain closed.

The time series analysis is formulated as a weighted least squares inversion. The inversion is un­ biased for a fully connected network of interferograms without multiple subsets, such as provided by modern SAR satellites with small orbital tube and short revisit time. In the routine workflow, we first invert the inter­ ferogram stack for the raw phase time-series, then correct for the deterministic phase components: the tropo­ spheric delay (using global atmospheric models or the delay-elevation ratio), the topographic residual and/or phase ramp, to obtain the noise-reduced displacement time-series. Next, we estimate the average velocity excluding noisy SAR acquisitions, which are identified using an outlier detection method based on the root mean square of the residual phase. The routine workflow includes three new methods to correct or exclude phaseunwrapping errors for two-dimensional algorithms: (i) the bridging method connecting reliable regions with minimum spanning tree bridges (particularly suitable for islands), (ii) the phase closure method exploiting the conservativeness of the integer ambiguity of interferogram triplets (well suited for highly redundant networks), and (iii) coherence-based network modification to identify and exclude interferograms with remaining coherent phase-unwrapping errors. We apply the routine workflow to the Gala�pagos volcanoes using Sentinel-1 and ALOS1 data, assess the qualities of the essential steps in the workflow and compare the results with independent GPS measurements. We discuss the advantages and limitations of temporal coherence as a reliability measure, evaluate the impact of network redundancy on the precision and reliability of the InSAR measurements and its practical implication for interferometric pairs selection. A comparison with another open-source time series analysis software demonstrates the superior performance of the approach implemented in MintPy in challenging scenarios.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Yunjun","given":"Zhang"},{"family":"Fattahi","given":"Heresh"},{"family":"Amelung","given":"Falk"}],"citation-key":"Yunjun.etal_2019_SmallBaseline","container-title":"Computers & Geosciences","container-title-short":"Computers & Geosciences","DOI":"10.1016/j.cageo.2019.104331","ISSN":"00983004","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",12]]},"language":"en","note":"ZSCC:00122","page":"104331","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Small baseline InSAR time series analysis: Unwrapping error correction and noise reduction","title-short":"Small baseline InSAR time series analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0098300419304194","volume":"133"},

  {"id":"Yunjun.etal_2022_RangeGeolocation","abstract":"Time series analysis of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and interferometric SAR generally starts with coregistration for the precise alignment of the stack of images. Here, we introduce a model-adjusted geometrical image coregistration (MAGIC) algorithm for stack coregistration. This algorithm corrects for atmospheric propagation delays and known surface motions using existing models and ensures simplicity and computational efficiency in the data processing systems. We validate this approach by evaluating the impact of different geolocation errors on stacks of the C-band Sentinel-1 and L-band ALOS-2 data, with a focus on the ionosphere. Our results show that the impact of the ionosphere dominates Sentinel-1 ascending (dusk-side) orbit and ALOS-2 data. After correcting for ionosphere using the JPL high-resolution global ionospheric maps, with topside total electron content (TEC) estimated from GPS receivers onboard the Sentinel-1 platforms, solid Earth tides, and troposphere, the mis-registration RMSE reduces by over a factor of four from 0.20 to 0.05 m for Sentinel-1 and from 2.66 to 0.56 m for ALOS-2. The results demonstrate that for Sentinel-1, the MAGIC approach is accurate enough in the range direction for most applications, including interferometry; while for the L-band SAR, it can be potentially accurate enough if topside TEC is available. Based on our current understanding of different error sources, we evaluate the expected range geolocation error budget for the upcoming NISAR mission with an upper bound of the relative geolocation error of 1.3 and 0.2 m for its L- and S-band SAR, respectively.","author":[{"family":"Yunjun","given":"Zhang"},{"family":"Fattahi","given":"Heresh"},{"family":"Pi","given":"Xiaoqing"},{"family":"Rosen","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Simons","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Agram","given":"Piyush"},{"family":"Aoki","given":"Yosuke"}],"citation-key":"Yunjun.etal_2022_RangeGeolocation","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","DOI":"10.1109/TGRS.2022.3168509","ISSN":"1558-0644","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"note":"ZSCC:00002","page":"1-19","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Range Geolocation Accuracy of C-/L-Band SAR and its Implications for Operational Stack Coregistration","type":"article-journal","volume":"60"},

The spatial properties of these errors have been well studied, but, to date, their temporal dependence and correction have received much less attention. Here, we present an evaluation of the magnitude of tropospheric artifacts in derived time series after compensation using an algorithm that requires only the InSAR data. The level of artifact reduction equals or exceeds that from many weather model-based methods, while avoiding the need to globally access fine-scale atmosphere parameters at all times. Our method consists of identifying all points in an InSAR stack with consistently high correlation and computing, and then removing, a fit of the phase at each of these points with respect to elevation. A comparison with GPS truth yields a reduction of three, from a rms misfit of 5&ndash;6 to ~2 cm over time. This algorithm can be readily incorporated into InSAR processing flows without the need for outside information.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Zebker","given":"Howard"}],"citation-key":"Zebker_2021_AccuracyModelFree","container-title":"Remote Sensing","DOI":"10.3390/rs13030409","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","note":"ZSCC:00012","number":"3","page":"409","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Accuracy of a Model-Free Algorithm for Temporal InSAR Tropospheric Correction","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/3/409","volume":"13"},

We demonstrate with an example in which we average unwrapped interferogram phase stacks that span over a transient event how a noise covariance model can aid in noise reduction.

Multilooking or spatial averaging is commonly used to reduce stochastic noise over a neighborhood of distributed scatterers in interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) measurements. However, multilooking may break consistency among a triplet of interferometric phases formed from three acquisitions leading to a residual phase error called closure phase. Understanding the cause of closure phase in multilooked InSAR measurements and the impact of closure phase errors on the performance of InSAR time-series algorithms is crucial for quantifying the uncertainty of ground displacement time series derived from InSAR measurements. We develop a model that consistently explains both closure phase and systematic bias in multilooked interferometric measurements. We show that nonzero closure phase can be an indicator of temporally inconsistent physical processes that alter both phase and amplitude of interferometric measurements. We propose a method to estimate the systematic bias in the InSAR time series with generalized closure phase measurements. We validate our model with a case study in Barstow-Bristol Trough, CA, USA. We find systematic differences on the order of cm/year between InSAR time-series results using subsets of varying maximum temporal baselines.

Bubble-free magma provides the lower limit on compressibility, thus an upper bound on the chamber volume of 13.6–20.6 km3, depending on fault dip. We estimate an upper limit on compressibility using a conduit model relating volatile content to lava fountain height, compared with observations from the 2005 eruption, constrained by volatile content of olivine melt inclusions. This yields a lower bound on chamber volume roughly half the upper bound.

  {"id":"Zheng.Zebker_2017_PhaseCorrection","abstract":"We present a new interferometric synthetic aperture radar processing approach that removes topography-dependent phase from single-look complex (SLC) radar images, making interferogram formation more efficient. We first adopt motion compensation techniques to resample SLC images with respect to an ideal reference orbit and then separate the residual topographic phase contributions into parts dependent only on individual SLC acquisitions, and generate topography-compensated images directly in latitude-longitude coordinates. Since the number of interferograms is typically much larger than the number of SLC images, our approach greatly reduces needed computational resources. Furthermore, we move the need for precise knowledge of imaging geometry upstream from the end user to the data provider. We demonstrate our approach for both preprocessed SLC images and raw data using COSMO-SkyMed L1A and ALOS L0 products. The performance of our method depends on the quality of the digital elevation model (DEM) used-DEM error affects the correction phase proportionally to the baseline between radar scenes and the reference orbital path.

  {"id":"ZhongchengCao.TengWang_2022_WatertemperatureControlled","abstract":"Loess deposits are widely distributed in western and central China. Because loess is wet-collapsible, loess mass is prone to failure after water infiltration. Heifangtai, composed of two adjacent typical loess platforms located in the Loess Plateau beside the Yellow River, has experienced hundreds of landslides in the past few decades. Here, we derived surficial time-series deformation, velocity, and amplitude of seasonality from the Sentinel-1 SAR images acquired from October 2014 to March 2021 in the Heifangtai region and studied their relation with precipitation, temperature, and irrigation applying wavelet analysis. The decomposed velocities show that not only a large amount of along-slope deformation occurred surrounding the terrace but also a significant subsidence in the residential area in the middle of the platform was observed. The high-seasonality areas are distributed along the Yellow River and on the terrace consistent with other water sources, e.g., springs and irrigation, revealing a promotion of a periodic water-involved process on deformation in loess. Through the wavelet analysis, we found that the temperature is almost in phase with the uplift velocity when the temperature is below the freezing point. The precipitation precedes the surface displacement of ∼1 to 2 months for water penetration. The comparison between irrigation volumes and averaged displacements suggests that irrigation also plays a role in promoting subsidence from March to October but uplift in winter due to frost heave. We highlight that the retrogressions of the terraces in this region may be accelerated by both natural and anthropogenic factors. Careful monitoring and water management are highly recommended for the safety of local residences and infrastructures.","author":[{"literal":"Zhongcheng Cao"},{"literal":"Teng Wang"}],"citation-key":"ZhongchengCao.TengWang_2022_WatertemperatureControlled","container-title":"Frontiers in Environmental Science","DOI":"10.3389/fenvs.2022.957339","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"note":"MAG ID: 4294325521","title":"Water-temperature controlled deformation patterns in Heifangtai loess terraces revealed by wavelet analysis of InSAR time series and hydrological parameters","type":"article-journal"},

Analysis of the surface heat flow surrounding the fault trace leads to a constraint on the frictional power generated on the fault—the mechanism behind the San Andreas fault (SAF) heat flow paradox. We revisit this paradox from a new perspective using an estimate of the long-term accumulating elastic power in the region surrounding the fault, and analyze the paradox using two parameters: the seismic efficiency and the elastic power. The results show that the constraint on frictional power from the classic interpretation is incompatible with the accumulating elastic power and the radiated power from earthquake catalogs. We then explore four mechanisms that can resolve this extended paradox. First, stochastic fluctuations of surface heat flow could mask the fault-generated anomaly (we estimate 21% probability). Second, the elastic power accumulating in the region could be overestimated (≥550 MW required). Third, the seismic efficiency—ratio of radiated energy to elastic work—of the SAF could be higher than that of the remaining faults in the region (≥5.8% required). Fourth, the scaled energy—ratio of radiated energy to seismic moment—on the SAF could be lower than on the remaining faults in the region (a factor 5 difference required). In the last three hypotheses, we analyze the interplay of the energy budget on a single fault with the total energy budget of the region.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Ziebarth","given":"Malte J."},{"family":"Anderson","given":"John G."},{"family":"Specht","given":"Sebastian","non-dropping-particle":"von"},{"family":"Heidbach","given":"Oliver"},{"family":"Cotton","given":"Fabrice"}],"citation-key":"Ziebarth.etal_2023_RevisitingSan","container-title":"Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth","DOI":"10.1029/2023JB027086","ISSN":"2169-9356","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2023.

Interaction between different faults is imposed in terms of  stress increase and decrease resulting in three possible ways: the occurrence of an  earthquake is advanced or delayed, or the earthquake is triggered instantaneously.  The results indicate the existence of two regimes: for weakly coupled faults, the  recurrence time distribution of earthquakes on one fault follows mostly the Brownian  passage-time distribution. For a strongly coupled system, the faults are synchronized  and the effect of instantaneous triggering becomes dominant: the recurrence time distribution follows a Gamma or a Weibull distribution. The transition from weak to  strong coupling is abrupt and behaves like a phase transition. It occurs when the  stress transfer equals the average stress deficit. The results are interpreted in terms  of a phase diagram. This diagram includes a regime, where the distribution of recurrence  times is similar to a numerical model for California.
